some way off the center of anothergrouphe princess smiled he rose with the same unchanging smile with whichshe had first entered the roomthe smile of a perfectly beautifulwoman ith a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss andivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparklingdiamonds she passed between the men who made way for her not lookingat any of them but smiling on all as if graciously allowing each theprivilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders backand bosomwhich in the fashion of those days were very much exposedand she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she movedtoward nna avlovna elene was so lovely that not only did she notshow any trace of coquetry but on the contrary she even appeared shy ofher unquestionable and all too victorious beauty he seemed to wishbut to be unable to diminish its effectow lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted hisshoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinarywhen she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with herunchanging smileadame  doubt my ability before such an audience said he smilinglyinclining his headhe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considereda reply unnecessary he smilingly waited ll the time the story wasbeing told she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round armaltered in

circle andmoving a chair close to hers seated himself beside here charmant ippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance tohis beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite of thisresemblance he was exceedingly ugly is features were like hissisters but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous selfsatisfied youthful and constant smile of animation and by thewonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the contrary wasdulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen selfconfidence while his body was thin and weak is eyes nose and mouthall seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace and his arms andlegs always fell into unnatural positionsts not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down beside theprincess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without thisinstrument he could not begin to speakhy no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugging hisshouldersecause  hate ghost stories said rince ippolyte in a tone

stupid e was dressed in adarkgreen dress coat knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nympheeffrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockingshe vicomte told his tale very neatly t was an anecdote then

very pretty and interesting especially at the point wherethe rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies lookedagitatedharming said nna avlovna with an inquiring glance at the littleprincessharming whispered the little princess sticking the needle into herwork as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the storyprevented her from going on with ithe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared to continue but just then nna avlovna who had kept awatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that he wastalking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried to therescue ierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe aboutthe balance of power and the latter evidently interested by the youngmans simpleminded eagerness was explaining his pet theory oth weretalking and listening too eagerly and too naturally which was why nnaavlovna disapprovedhe means are the balance of power in urope and the

round toward thelittle princess and having asked for a needle began tracing the ondecoat of arms on the table e explained this to her with as much gravityas if she had asked him to do itaton de

which heis better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others butfollows the current of his own thoughts things will have gone too fary intrigues violence exile and executions rench society meangood rench societywill have been forever destroyed and thene shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands ierre wished tomake a remark for the conversation interested him but nna avlovnawho had him under observation interruptedhe mperor lexander said she with the melancholy which alwaysaccompanied any reference of hers to the mperial family has declaredthat he will leave it to the rench people themselves to choose theirown form of government and  believe that once free from the usurperthe whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of itsrightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalistemigranthat is doubtful said rince ndrew onsieur le icomte quiterightly supposes that matters have already gone too far  think it willbe difficult to return to the old regimerom what  have heard said ierre blushing and breaking into theconversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over toonapartes sidet is the uonapartists who say that replied the vicomte withoutlooking at ierre t the present time it is difficult to know the realstate of rench public opiniononaparte has said so remarked rince ndrew with a sarcastic smilet was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming hisremarks at him though without looking at him showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it rincendrew continued after a short silence again quoting apoleons words opened my antechambers and they crowded in  do not know how farhe was justified in saying soot in the least replied the vicomte fter the murder of the duceven the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero f to somepeople he went on turning to nna avlovna he ever was a heroafter the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and onehero less on earthefore nna avlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciationof the vicomtes epigram ierre again broke into the conversation andthough nna avlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate shewas unable to stop himhe execution of the uc dnghien declared onsieur ierre was apolitical necessity and it seems to me that apoleon showed greatnessof soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility ofthat deedieu on ieu muttered nna avlovna in a terrified whisperhat onsieur ierre o you consider that assassination showsgreatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing herwork nearer to herh h exclaimed several voicesapital said rince ippolyte in nglish and began slapping his kneewith the palm of his handhe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders ierre looked solemnly at hisaudience over his spectacles and continued say so he continued desperately because the ourbons fled fromthe evolution leaving the people to anarchy and apoleon aloneunderstood the evolution and quelled it and so for the general goodhe could not stop short for the sake of one mans lifeont you come over to the other table suggested nna avlovnaut ierre continued his speech without heeding hero cried he becoming more and more eager apoleon is great becausehe rose superior to the evolution suppressed its abuses preserved allthat was good in itequality of citizenship and freedom of speech andof the pressand only for that reason did he obtain poweres if having obtained power without availing himself of it to commitmurder he had restored it to the rightful king  should have called hima great man remarked the vicomtee could not do that he people only gave him power that he might ridthem of the ourbons and because they saw that he was a great man heevolution was a grand thing continued onsieur ierre betraying bythis desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and hiswish to express all that was in his mindhat evolution and regicide a grand thing ell after that utwont you come to this other table repeated nna avlovnaousseaus ontrat ocial said the vicomte with a tolerant smile am not speaking of regicide  am speaking about ideases ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected anironical voicehose were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most importanthat is important are the rights of man emancipation from prejudicesand equality of citizenship and all these ideas apoleon has retainedin full forceiberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at lastdeciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words werehighsounding words which have long been discredited ho does not loveliberty and equality ven our aviour preached liberty and equalityave people since the evolution become happier n the contrary ewanted liberty but uonaparte has destroyed itrince ndrew kept looking with an amused smile from ierre to thevicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess n the first moment ofierres outburst nna avlovna despite her social experience washorrorstruck ut when she saw that ierres sacrilegious words had notexasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it wasimpossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte ina vigorous attack on the oratorut my dear onsieur ierre said she how do you explain the factof a great man executing a ducor even an ordinary man whois innocentand untried should like said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explains theth rumaire was not that an imposture t was a swindle and not atall like the conduct of a great mannd the prisoners he killed in frica hat was horrible said thelittle princess shrugging her shoulderses a low fellow say what you will remarked rince ippolyteierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled issmile was unlike the halfsmile of other people hen he smiled hisgrave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by anothera childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to askforgivenesshe vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that thisyoung acobin was not so terrible as his words suggested ll weresilentow do you expect him to answer you all at once said rince ndrewesides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish betweenhis acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor o itseems to mees yes of course ierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of thisreinforcementne must admit continued rince ndrew that apoleon as a man wasgreat on the bridge of rcola and in the hospital at affa where hegave his hand to the plaguestricken but but there are other actswhich it is difficult to justifyrince ndrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness ofierres remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time togouddenly rince ippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attendand asking them all to be seated began was told a charming oscow story today and must treat you to itxcuse me icomte must tell it in ussian or the point will belost nd rince ippolyte began to tell his story in such ussianas a renchman would speak after spending about a year in ussiaveryone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand theirattention to his storyhere is in oscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy he musthave two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones hat was hertaste nd she had a ladys maid also big he saidere rince ippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas withdifficultyhe said h yes he said irl to the maid put on a liveryget up behind the carriage and come with me while  make some callsere rince ippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before hisaudience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator everalpersons among them the elderly lady and nna avlovna did howeversmilehe went uddenly there was a great wind he girl lost her hat andher long hair came down ere he could contain himself no longer andwent on between gasps of laughter nd the whole world knewnd so the anecdote ended hough it was unintelligible why he had toldit or why it had to be told in ussian still nna avlovna and theothers appreciated rince ippolytes social tact in so agreeably endingierres unpleasant and unamiable outburst fter the anecdote theconversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last andnext balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when andwhere aving thanked nna avlovna for her charming soiree the guests beganto take their leaveierre was ungainly tout about the average height broad with hugered hands he did not know as the saying is how to enter a drawingroom and still less how to leave one that is how to say somethingparticularly agreeable before going away esides this he was absentminded hen he rose to go he took up instead of his own the generalsthreecornered hat and held it pulling at the plume till the generalasked him to restore it ll his absentmindedness and inability toenter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by his kindlysimple and modest expression nna avlovna turned toward him and witha hristian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretionnodded and said  hope to see you again but  also hope you willchange your opinions my dear onsieur ierrehen she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybodysaw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps pinions areopinions but you see what a capital goodnatured fellow  am ndeveryone including nna avlovna felt thisrince ndrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders tothe footman who was helping him on with his

left the hallrince ippolyte approached the little princess and bending his faceclose to her began to whisper somethingwo footmen the princess and his own stood holding a shawl and acloak waiting for the conversation to finish hey listened to therench sentences which to them were meaningless with an air ofunderstanding but not wishing to appear to do so he princess as usualspoke smilingly and listened with a laugh am very glad  did not go to the ambassadors said rince ippolyteso dull t has been a delightful evening has it not elightfulhey say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing upher downy little lip ll the pretty women in society will be thereot all for you will not be there not all said rince ippolytesmiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footman whom he evenpushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess ither fromawkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after theshawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time asthough embracing hertill smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at herhusband rince ndrews eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did heseemre you ready he asked his wife looking past

found in the households of the newly marriedalfway through supper rince ndrew leaned his elbows on the table andwith a look of nervous agitation such as ierre had never before seen onhis face began to talkas one who has long had something on his mindand suddenly determines to speak outever never marry my dear fellow hats my advice never marry tillyou can say to yourself that you have done all you

off his spectacles which made his face seem different andthe goodnatured expression still more apparent and gazed at his friendin amazementy wife continued rince ndrew is an excellent woman one of thoserare women with whom a mans honor is safe but  od what would  notgive now to be unmarried ou are the first and only one to whom mention this because  like yous he said this rince ndrew was less than ever like that olkonski whohad lolled in nna avlovnas easy chairs and with halfclosed eyes haduttered rench phrases between his teeth very muscle of his thin facewas now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in which the fireof life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant light twas evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the moreimpassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritationou dont understand why  say this he continued but it is thewhole story of life ou talk of onaparte and his career said hethough ierre had not mentioned onaparte but onaparte when heworked went step by step toward his goal e was free he had nothingbut his aim to consider and he reached it ut tie yourself up with awoman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom nd all youhave of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you withregret rawing rooms gossip balls vanity and trivialitythese arethe enchanted circle  cannot escape from  am now going to the warthe greatest war there ever was and  know nothing and am fit fornothing  am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued rincendrew and at nna avlovnas they listen to me nd

women are whenyou see them in their true colors hen you meet them in society itseems as if there were something in them but theres nothing nothingnothing o dont marry my dear fellow dont marry concluded rincendrewt seems funny to me said ierre that you you should consideryourself incapable and your life a spoiled life ou have everythingbefore you everything nd youe did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly hethought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the futureow can he talk like that thought ierre e considered his friend amodel of perfection because rince ndrew possessed in the highestdegree just the very qualities ierre lacked and which might be bestdescribed as strength of will ierre was always astonished at rincendrews calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary memoryhis extensive reading he had read everything knew everything and hadan opinion about everything but above all at his capacity for work andstudy nd if ierre was often struck by ndrews lack of capacity forphilosophical meditation to which he himself was particularlyaddicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign ofstrengthven in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praiseand commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheelsthat they may run smoothlyy part is played out said rince ndrew hats the use of talkingabout me et us talk about you he added after a silence smiling athis reassuring thoughtshat smile was immediately reflected on ierres faceut what is there to say about me said ierre his face relaxing intoa

as if suddenly struck by a happy thoughtseriously  have long been thinking of it eading such a life cant decide or think properly about anything nes head aches and onespends all ones money e asked me for tonight but  wont goou give me your word of honor not to gon my honor t was past one oclock when ierre left his friend t was a cloudlessnorthern summer night ierre took an open cab intending to drivestraight home ut the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt theimpossibility of going to sleep on such a night t was light enough tosee a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning orevening than night n the way ierre remembered that natole uraginwas expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which therewas generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind ierrewas very fond of should like to go to uragins thought heut he immediately recalled his promise to rince ndrew not to gothere hen as happens to people of weak character he desired sopassionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed tothat he decided to go he thought immediately occurred to him that hispromise to rince ndrew was of no account because before he gave it hehad already promised rince natole to come to his gathering besidesthought he all such words of honor are conventional things with nodefinite meaning especially if one considers that by tomorrow one maybe dead or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor anddishonor will be all the same ierre often indulged in reflections ofthis sort nullifying all his decisions and intentions e went touraginseaching the large house near the orse uards barracks in whichnatole lived ierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairsand went in at the open door here was no one in

unchangingstonily severe expression and sitting down opposite the prince sheprepared to listen wished to get a nap mon cousin but  cantell my dear said rince asili taking her hand and bending itdownwards as was his habitt was plain that this well referred to much that they bothunderstood without naminghe princess who had a straight rigid body abnormally long for herlegs looked directly at rince asili with no sign of emotion in herprominent gray eyes hen she shook her head and glanced up at the iconswith a sigh his might have been taken as an expression of sorrow anddevotion or of weariness and hope of resting before long rince asiliunderstood it as an expression of wearinessnd  he said do you think it is easier for me  am as worn out asa post horse but still  must have a talk with you atiche a veryserious talkrince asili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously nowon one side now on the other giving his face an unpleasant expressionwhich was never to be seen on it in a drawing room is eyes too seemedstrange at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the nextglanced round in alarmhe princess holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bonyhands looked attentively into rince asilis eyes evidently resolvednot to be the first to break silence if she had to wait till morningell you see my dear princess and cousin atherine emenovnacontinued rince asili returning to his theme apparently not withoutan inner struggle at such a moment as this one must think ofeverything ne must think of the future of all of you  love youall like children of my own as you knowhe princess continued to look at him without moving and with the samedull expressionnd then of course my family has also to be considered rince asiliwent on testily pushing away a little table without looking at herou know atiche that weyou three sisters amontov and my wifeare the counts only direct heirs  know  know how hard it is for youto talk or think of such matters t is no easier for me but my dear am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything o you know have sent for ierre he count pointing to his portraitdefinitely demanded that he should be calledrince asili looked questioningly at the princess but could not makeout whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she wassimply looking at himhere is one thing  constantly pray od to grant mon cousin shereplied and it is that e would be merciful to him and would allow hisnoble soul peacefully to leave thises yes of course interrupted rince asili impatiently rubbinghis bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table thathe had pushed away ut in short the fact is you know yourselfthat last winter the count made a will by which he left all hisproperty not to us his direct heirs but to ierree has made wills enough quietly remarked the princess ut hecannot leave the estate to ierre ierre is illegitimateut my dear said rince asili suddenly clutching the little tableand becoming more animated and talking more rapidly what if a letterhas been written to the mperor in which the count asks for ierreslegitimation o you understand that in consideration of the countsservices his request would be grantedhe princess smiled as people do who think they know more about thesubject under discussion than those they are talking with can tell you more continued rince asili seizing her hand thatletter was written though it was not sent and the mperor knew of ithe only question is has it been destroyed or not f not then as soonas all is over and rince asili sighed to intimate what he meant bythe words all is over and the counts papers are opened the will andletter will be delivered to the mperor and the petition will certainlybe granted ierre will get everything as the legitimate sonnd our share asked the princess smiling ironically as if anythingmight happen only not thatut my poor atiche it is as clear as daylight e will then be thelegal heir to everything and you wont get anything ou must know mydear whether the will and letter were written and whether they havebeen destroyed or not nd if they have somehow been overlooked youought to know where they are and must find them becausehat next the princess interrupted smiling sardonically and notchanging the expression of her eyes  am a woman and you think we areall stupid but  know this an illegitimate son cannot inherit unbatard  she added as if supposing that this translation of the wordwould effectively prove to rince asili the invalidity of hiscontention  bastardell really atiche ant you understand ou are so intelligenthow is it you dont see that if the count has written a letter to themperor begging him to recognize ierre as legitimate it follows thatierre will not be ierre but will become ount ezukhov and will theninherit everything under the will nd if the will and letter are notdestroyed then you will have nothing but the consolation of having beendutiful et tout ce qui sensuit  hats certain nd all that follows therefrom know the will was made but  also know that it is invalid and youmon cousin seem to consider me a perfect fool said the princess withthe expression women assume when they suppose they are saying somethingwitty and stingingy dear rincess atherine emenovna began rince asili impatiently came here not to wrangle with you but to talk about

you and yoursisters are not heiresses f you dont believe me then believe anexpert  have just been talking to mitri nufrich the familysolicitor and he says the samet this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideas herthin lips grew white though her eyes did not change and her voice whenshe began to speak passed through such transitions as she herselfevidently did not expecthat would be a fine thing said she  never wanted anything and dont nowhe pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dressnd this is gratitudethis is recognition for those who havesacrificed everything for his sake she cried ts splendid ine dont want anything rincees but you are not the only one here are your sisters repliedrince asiliut the princess did not listen to himes  knew it long ago but had

invalideve got to it at lastwhy did you not tell me about it soonerts in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow said theprincess ignoring his question ow  know es if  have a sin agreat sin it is hatred of that vile woman almost shrieked theprincess now quite changed nd what does she come worming herself inhere for ut  will give her a piece of my mind he time will come hile these conversations were going on in the reception room and theprincess room a carriage containing ierre who had been sent for andnna ikhaylovna who found it necessary to accompany him was drivinginto the court of ount ezukhovs house s the wheels rolled softlyover the straw beneath the windows nna ikhaylovna having turned withwords of comfort to her companion realized that he was asleep in hiscorner and woke him up ousing himself ierre followed nnaikhaylovna out of the carriage and only then began to think of theinterview with his dying father which awaited him e noticed that theyhad not come to the front entrance but to the back door hile he wasgetting down from the carriage steps two men who looked liketradespeople ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow ofthe wall ausing for a moment ierre noticed several other men of thesame kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides ut neithernna ikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman who could not helpseeing these people took any notice of them t seems to be allright ierre concluded and followed nna ikhaylovna he hurriedlyascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase calling to ierre whowas lagging behind to follow hough he did not see why it wasnecessary for him to go to the count at all still less why he had to goby the back stairs yet judging by nna ikhaylovnas air of assuranceand haste ierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessaryalfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men whocarrying pails came running downstairs their boots clattering hesemen pressed close to the wall to let ierre and nna ikhaylovna passand did not evince the least surprise at seeing them theres this the way to the princesses apartments asked nna ikhaylovnaof one of themes replied a footman in a bold loud voice as if anything were nowpermissible the door to the left maamerhaps the count did not ask for me said ierre when he reached thelanding d better go to my own roomnna ikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come uph my friend she said touching his arm as she had done her sonswhen speaking to him that afternoon believe me  suffer no less thanyou do but be a manut really hadnt  better go away he asked looking kindly at herover his spectaclesh my dear friend orget the wrongs that may have been done youhink that he is your father perhaps in the agony of death hesighed  have loved you like a son from the first rust yourself tome ierre  shall not forget your interestsierre did not understand a word but the conviction that all this hadto be grew stronger and he meekly followed nna ikhaylovna who wasalready opening a doorhis door led into a back anteroom n old man a servant of theprincesses sat in a corner knitting a stocking ierre had never beenin this part of the house and did not even know of the existence ofthese rooms nna ikhaylovna addressing a maid who was hurrying pastwith a decanter on a tray as my dear and my sweet asked about theprincess health and then led ierre along a stone passage he firstdoor on the left led into the princesses apartments he maid with thedecanter in her haste had not closed the door everything in the housewas done in haste at that time and ierre and nna ikhaylovna inpassing instinctively glanced into the room where rince asili and theeldest princess were sitting close together talking eeing them passrince asili drew back with obvious impatience while the princessjumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with allher mighthis action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted onrince asilis face so out of keeping with his dignity that ierrestopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide nnaikhaylovna evinced no surprise she only smiled faintly and sighed asif to say that this was no more than she had expectede a man my friend  will look after your interests said she inreply to his look and went still faster along the passageierre could not make out what it was all about and still less whatwatching over his interests meant but he decided that all thesethings had to be rom the passage they went into a large dimly litroom adjoining the counts reception room t was one of those sumptuousbut cold apartments known to ierre only from the front approach buteven in this room there now stood an empty bath and water had beenspilled on the carpet hey were met by a deacon with a censer and by aservant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them hey went intothe reception room familiar to ierre with two talian windows openinginto the conservatory with its large bust and full length portrait ofatherine the reat he same people were still sitting here in almostthe same positions as before whispering to one another ll becamesilent and turned to look at the pale tearworn nna ikhaylovna as sheentered and at the big stout figure of ierre who hanging his headmeekly followed hernna ikhaylovnas face expressed a consciousness that the decisivemoment had arrived ith the air of a practical etersburg lady she nowkeeping ierre close beside her entered the room even more boldly thanthat afternoon he felt that as she brought with her the person thedying man wished to see her own admission was assured asting a rapidglance at all those in the room and noticing the counts confessorthere she glided up to him with a sort of amble not exactly bowing yetseeming to grow suddenly smaller and respectfully received the blessingfirst of one and then of another priestod be thanked that you are in time said she to one of the priestsall we relatives have been in such anxiety his young man is thecounts son she added more softly hat a terrible momentaving said this she went up to the doctorear doctor said she this young man is the counts son s thereany hopehe doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged hisshoulders nna ikhaylovna with just the same movement raised hershoulders and eyes almost closing the latter sighed and moved awayfrom the doctor to ierre o him in a particularly respectful andtenderly sad voice she saidrust in is mercy and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit andwait for her she went silently toward the door that everyone waswatching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind itierre having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly movedtoward the sofa she had indicated s soon as nna ikhaylovna haddisappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to himwith something more than curiosity and sympathy e noticed that theywhispered to one another casting significant looks at him with a kindof awe and even servility  deference such as he had never beforereceived was shown him  strange lady the one who had been talking tothe priests rose and offered him her seat an aidedecamp picked upand returned a glove ierre had dropped the doctors became respectfullysilent as he passed by and moved to make way for him t first ierrewished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady and also topick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were noteven in his way but all at once he felt that this would not do andthat tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful ritewhich everyone expected of him and that he was therefore bound toaccept their services e took the glove in silence from the aidedecamp and sat down in the ladys chair placing his huge handssymmetrically on his knees in the naive attitude of an gyptian statueand decided in his own mind that all was as it should be and that inorder not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on hisown ideas tonight but must yield himself up entirely to the will ofthose who were guiding himot two minutes had passed before rince asili with head erectmajestically entered the room e was wearing his long coat with threestars on his breast e seemed to have grown thinner since the morninghis eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticedierre e went up to him took his hand a thing he never used to doand drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmlyfixed onourage courage my friend e has asked to see you hat is welland he turned to gout ierre thought it necessary to ask ow is and hesitated notknowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man the countyet ashamed to call him fathere had another stroke about half an hour ago ourage my friendierres mind was in such a confused state that the word strokesuggested to him a blow from something e looked at rince asili inperplexity and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack ofillness rince asili said something to orrain in passing and wentthrough the door on tiptoe e could not walk well on tiptoe and hiswhole body jerked at each step he eldest princess followed him andthe priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the doorhrough that door was heard a noise of things being moved about and atlast nna ikhaylovna still with the same expression pale but resolutein the discharge of duty ran out and touching ierre lightly on the armsaidhe divine mercy is inexhaustible nction is about to be administeredomeierre went in at the door stepping on the soft carpet and noticedthat the strange lady the aidedecamp and some of the servants allfollowed him in as if there were now no further need for permission toenter that room ierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch itswalls hung round with ersian carpets he part of the room behind thecolumns with a high silkcurtained mahogany bedstead on one side and onthe other an immense case containing icons was brightly illuminatedwith red light like a ussian church during evening service nder thegleaming icons stood a long invalid chair and in that chair on snowywhite smooth pillows evidently freshly changed ierre sawcovered tothe waist by a bright green quiltthe familiar majestic figure of hisfather ount ezukhov with that gray mane of hair above his broadforehead which reminded one of a lion and the deep characteristicallynoble wrinkles of his handsome ruddy face e lay just under the iconshis large thick hands outside the quilt nto the right hand which waslying palm downwards a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger andthumb and an old servant bending over from behind the chair held itin position y the chair stood the priests their long hair fallingover their magnificent glittering vestments with lighted tapers intheir hands slowly and solemnly conducting the service  little behindthem stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to

glanceround nna ikhaylovna with a meek sorrowful and allforgivingexpression on her face stood by the door near the strange lady rinceasili in front of the door near the invalid chair a wax taper in hisleft hand was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chairhe had turned round for the purpose and was crossing himself with hisright hand turning his eyes upward each time he touched his foreheadis face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of odf you do not understand these sentiments he seemed to be saying somuch the worse for youehind him stood the aidedecamp the doctors and the menservants themen and women had separated as in church ll were silently crossingthemselves and the reading of the church service the subdued chantingof deep bass voices and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling offeet were the only sounds that could be heard nna ikhaylovna with anair of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she wasabout went across the room to where ierre was standing and gave him ataper e lit it and distracted by observing those around him begancrossing himself with the hand that held the taperophie the rosy laughterloving youngest princess with the molewatched him he smiled hid her face in her handkerchief and remainedwith it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing ierre she againbegan to laugh he evidently felt unable to look at him withoutlaughing but could not resist looking at him so to be out oftemptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns n the midstof the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased they whisperedto one another and the old servant who was holding the counts hand gotup and said something to the ladies nna ikhaylovna stepped forwardand stooping over the dying man beckoned to orrain from behind herback he rench doctor held no taper he was leaning against one of thecolumns in a respectful attitude implying that he a foreigner in spiteof all differences of faith understood the full importance of the ritenow being performed and even approved of it e now approached the sickman with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life with hisdelicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that wasfree and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment hesick man was given something to drink there was a stir around him thenthe people resumed their places and the service continued uring thisinterval ierre noticed that rince asili left the chair on which hehad been leaning andwith an air which intimated that he knew what hewas about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worsefor themdid not go up to the dying man but passed by him joined theeldest princess and moved with her to the side of the room where stoodthe high bedstead with its silken hangings n leaving the bed bothrince asili and the princess passed out by a back door but returnedto their places one after the other before the service was concludedierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest ofwhat went on having made up his mind once for all that what he sawhappening around him that evening was in some way essentialhe chanting of the service ceased and the voice of the priest washeard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received thesacrament he dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before roundhim everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers among whichnna ikhaylovnas was the most distinctierre heard her sayertainly he must be moved onto the bed here it will be impossiblehe sick man was so surrounded by doctors princesses and servants thatierre could no longer see the reddishyellow face with its gray manewhich though he saw other faces as well he had not lost sight of for asingle moment during the whole service e judged by the cautiousmovements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they hadlifted the dying man and were moving himatch hold of my arm or youll drop him he heard one of the servantssay in a frightened whisper atch hold from underneath ereexclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of the bearers andthe shuffling of their feet grew more hurried as if the weight theywere carrying were too much for thems the bearers among whom was nna ikhaylovna passed the young man hecaught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dyingmans high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised bythose who were holding him under the armpits and of his gray curlyleonine head his head with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbonesits handsome sensual mouth and its cold majestic expression was notdisfigured by the approach of death t was the same as ierreremembered it three months before when the count had sent him toetersburg ut now this head was swaying helplessly with the unevenmovements of the bearers and the cold listless gaze fixed itself uponnothingfter a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead those who hadcarried the sick man dispersed nna ikhaylovna touched ierres handand said ome ierre went with her to the bed on which the sick manhad been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony justcompleted e lay with his head propped high on the pillows is handswere symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt the palms downwardhen ierre came up the count was gazing straight at him but with alook the significance of which could not be understood by mortal manither this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes theymust look somewhere or it meant too much ierre hesitated not knowingwhat to do and glanced inquiringly at his guide nna ikhaylovna madea hurried sign with her eyes glancing at the sick mans hand and movingher lips as if to send it a kiss ierre carefully stretching his neckso as not to touch the quilt followed her suggestion and pressed hislips to the large boned fleshy hand either the hand nor a singlemuscle of the counts face stirred nce more ierre lookedquestioningly at nna ikhaylovna to see what he was to do next nnaikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bedierre obediently sat down his eyes asking if he were doing right nnaikhaylovna nodded approvingly gain ierre fell into the naivelysymmetrical pose of an gyptian statue evidently distressed that hisstout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to lookas small as possible e looked at the count who still gazed at thespot where ierres face had been before he sat down nna ikhaylovnaindicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importanceof these last moments of meeting between the father and son his lastedabout two minutes which to ierre seemed an hour uddenly the broadmuscles and lines of the counts face began to twitch he twitchingincreased the handsome mouth was drawn to one side only now did ierrerealize how near death his father was and from that distorted mouthissued an indistinct hoarse sound nna ikhaylovna looked attentivelyat the sick mans eyes trying to guess what he wanted she pointedfirst to ierre then to some drink then named rince asili in aninquiring whisper then pointed to the quilt he eyes and face of thesick man showed impatience e made an effort to look at the servant whostood constantly at the head of the bedants to turn on the other side whispered the servant and got up toturn the counts heavy body toward the wallierre rose to help himhile the count was being turned over one of his arms fell backhelplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward hether henoticed the look of terror with which ierre regarded that lifeless armor whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain at anyrate he glanced at the refractory arm at ierres terrorstricken faceand again at the arm and on his face a feeble piteous smile appearedquite out of keeping with his features that seemed to deride his ownhelplessness t sight of this smile ierre felt an unexpected quiveringin his breast and a tickling in his nose and tears dimmed his eyes hesick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall e sighede is dozing said nna ikhaylovna observing that one of theprincesses was coming to take her turn at watching et us goierre went out here was now no one in the reception room except rince asili and theeldest princess who were sitting under the portrait of atherine thereat and talking

brilliantly lighted mirrors whichrepeated their reflections several times ow this same room was dimlylighted by two candles n one small table tea things and supper dishesstood in disorder and in the middle of the night a motley throng ofpeople sat there not merrymaking but somberly whispering andbetraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot whatwas happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom ierre didnot eat anything though he would very much have liked to e lookedinquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoeto the reception room

me that among some good things it contains others which our weakhuman understanding cannot grasp it seems to me rather useless to spendtime in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit never could understand the fondness some people have for confusingtheir minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken theirdoubts and excite their imagination giving them a bent for exaggerationquite contrary to hristian simplicity et us rather read the pistlesand ospels et us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they containfor how can we miserable sinners that we are know the terrible andholy secrets of rovidence while we remain in this flesh which forms animpenetrable veil between us and the ternal et us rather confineourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine aviour hasleft for our guidance here below et us try to conform to them andfollow them and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeblehuman minds roam the better we shall please od who

tactician said the prince to his son pointing to thearchitectnd the conversation again turned on the war on onaparte and thegenerals and statesmen of the day he old prince seemed convinced notonly that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the   of war or of politics and that onaparte was an insignificantlittle renchy successful only because there were no longer anyotemkins or uvorovs left to oppose him but he was also convinced thatthere were no political difficulties in urope and no real war but onlya sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playingpretending to do something real rince ndrew gaily bore with hisfathers ridicule of the new men and drew him on and listened to himwith evident pleasurehe past always seems good said he but did

regimental commander saluted the commanderinchief anddevoured him with his eyes drawing himself up obsequiously and fromthe way he walked through the ranks behind the generals bending forwardand hardly able to restrain his jerky movements and from the way hedarted forward at every word or gesture of the commanderinchief itwas evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with evengreater zeal than his duty as a commander hanks to the strictness andassiduity of its commander the regiment in comparison with others thathad reached raunau at the same time was in splendid condition herewere only  sick and stragglers verything was in good order exceptthe bootsutuzov walked through the ranks sometimes stopping to say a fewfriendly words to officers he had known in the urkish war sometimesalso to the soldiers ooking at their boots he several times shook hishead sadly pointing them out to the ustrian general with an expressionwhich seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone but could not helpnoticing what a bad state of things it was he regimental commander ranforward on each such occasion fearing to miss a single word of thecommanderinchiefs regarding the

regimental commanders backand mimicked his every movement ach time the commander started andbent forward the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the samemanner esvitski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at thewagutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which werestarting from their sockets to watch their chief n reaching the thirdcompany he suddenly stopped is suite not having expected thisinvoluntarily came closer to himh imokhin said he recognizing the rednosed captain who had beenreprimanded on account of the blue greatcoatne would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself morethan imokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimentalcommander but now that the commanderinchief addressed him he drewhimself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustainedit had the commanderinchief continued to look at him and so utuzovwho evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but goodquickly turned away a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over hisscarred and puffy facenother smail comrade said he  brave officer re you satisfiedwith him he asked the regimental commandernd the latterunconscious that he was being reflected in the hussarofficer as in a looking glassstarted moved forward and answeredighly satisfied your excellencye all have our weaknesses said utuzov smiling and walking away fromhim e used to have a predilection for acchushe regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and didnot answer he hussar at that moment noticed the face of the rednosedcaptain and his drawnin stomach and mimicked his expression and posewith such exactitude that esvitski could not help laughing utuzovturned round he officer evidently had complete control of his faceand while utuzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assumea most serious deferential and innocent expressionhe third company was the last and utuzov pondered apparently tryingto recollect something rince ndrew

waved his arms asif flinging something to the ground the drummera lean handsomesoldier of fortylooked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyeshen having satisfied himself that all eyes were

bower new chimed in twenty voices and the castanet playerin spite of the burden of his equipment rushed out to the front andwalking backwards before the company jerked his shoulders andflourished his castanets as if threatening someone he soldiersswinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously marched with longsteps ehind the company the sound of wheels the creaking of springsand the tramp of horses hoofs were heard utuzov and his suite werereturning to the town he commanderinchief made a sign that the menshould continue to march at ease and he and all his suite showedpleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancingsoldier and the gay and smartly marching men n the second file fromthe right flank beside which the carriage passed the company a blueeyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice t was olokhov marchingwith particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking atthose driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that momentmarching with the company he hussar cornet of utuzovs suite who hadmimicked the regimental commander fell back from the carriage and rodeup to olokhovussar cornet herkov had at one time in etersburg belonged to thewild set led by olokhov herkov had met olokhov abroad as a privateand had not seen fit to recognize him ut now that utuzov had spokento the gentleman ranker he addressed him with the cordiality of an oldfriendy dear fellow how are you said he through the singing making hishorse keep pace with the companyow am  olokhov answered coldly  am as you seehe lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easygaiety with which herkov spoke and to the intentional coldness ofolokhovs replynd how do you get on with the officers inquired herkovll right hey are good fellows nd how have you wriggled onto thestaff was attached m on dutyoth were silenthe let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve went the songarousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness heirconversation would probably have been different but for the effect ofthat songs it true that ustrians have been beaten asked olokhovhe devil only knows hey say som glad answered olokhov briefly and clearly as the song demanded say come round some evening and well have a game of faro saidherkovhy have you too much moneyo come cant ve sworn not to  wont drink and wont play till

then settled down galloped pastthe company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to the song n returning from the review utuzov took the ustrian general into hisprivate room and calling his adjutant asked for some papers relatingto the condition of the troops on their arrival and the letters thathad come from the rchduke erdinand who was in command of the advancedarmy rince ndrew olkonski came into the room with the requiredpapers utuzov and the ustrian member of the ofkriegsrath weresitting at the table on which a plan was spread outh said utuzov glancing at olkonski as if by this exclamation hewas asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with the conversation inrenchll  can say eneral said he with a pleasant elegance of expressionand intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spokenword t was evident that utuzov himself listened with pleasure to hisown voice ll  can say eneral is that if the matter depended on mypersonal wishes the will of is ajesty the mperor rancis would havebeen fulfilled long ago  should long ago have joined the archduke ndbelieve me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure tohand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a betterinformed and more skillful generalof whom ustria has so manyand tolay down all this heavy responsibility ut circumstances are sometimestoo strong for us eneralnd utuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say ou are quite atliberty not to believe me and  dont even care whether you do or notbut you have no grounds for telling me so nd that is the whole pointhe ustrian general looked dissatisfied but had no option but to replyin the same tonen the contrary he said in a querulous and angry tone thatcontrasted with his flattering words on the contrary yourexcellencys participation in the common action is highly valued by isajesty but we think the present delay is depriving the splendidussian troops and their commander of the laurels they have beenaccustomed to win in their battles he concluded his evidentlyprearranged sentenceutuzov bowed with the same smileut that is my conviction and judging by the last letter with whichis ighness the rchduke erdinand has honored me  imagine that theustrian troops under the direction of so skillful a leader as eneralack have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer needour aid said utuzovhe general frowned hough there was no definite news of an ustriandefeat there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumorsthat were afloat and so utuzovs suggestion of an ustrian victorysounded much like irony ut utuzov went on blandly smiling with thesame expression which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose sond in fact the last letter he had received from acks army informedhim of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army wasvery favorableive me that letter said utuzov turning to rince ndrew leasehave a look at itand utuzov with an ironical smile about the cornersof his mouth read to the ustrian general the following passage inerman from the rchduke erdinands lettere have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men withwhich to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the ech lso aswe are masters of lm we cannot be deprived of the advantage ofcommanding both sides of the anube so that should the enemy not crossthe ech we can cross the anube throw ourselves on his line ofcommunications recross the river lower down and frustrate hisintention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithfulally e shall therefore confidently await the moment when the mperialussian army will be fully equipped and shall then in conjunction withit easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deservesutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at themember of the ofkriegsrath mildly and attentivelyut you know the wise maxim your excellency advising one to expect theworst said the ustrian general evidently wishing to have done withjests and to come to business e involuntarily looked round at theaidedecampxcuse me eneral interrupted utuzov also turning to rincendrew ook here my dear fellow get from ozlovski all the reportsfrom our scouts ere are two letters from ount ostitz and here is onefrom is ighness the rchduke erdinand and here are these he saidhanding him several papers make a neat memorandum in rench out of allthis showing all the news we have had of the movements of the ustrianarmy and then give it to his excellencyrince ndrew bowed his head in token of having understood from thefirst not only what had been said but also what utuzov would have likedto tell him e gathered up the papers and with a bow to both steppedsoftly over the carpet and went out into the waiting roomhough not much time had passed since rince ndrew had left ussia hehad changed greatly during that period n the expression of his facein his movements in his walk scarcely a trace was

to take his stand so that they respected and evenfeared himoming out of utuzovs room into the waiting room with the papers inhis hand rince ndrew came up to his comrade the aidedecamp on dutyozlovski who was sitting at the window with a bookell rince asked ozlovski am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are notadvancingnd why is itrince ndrew shrugged his shouldersny news from ackof it were true that he has been beaten news would have comerobably said rince ndrew moving toward the outer doorut at that instant a tall ustrian general in a greatcoat with theorder of aria heresa on his neck and a black bandage round his headwho had evidently just arrived entered quickly slamming the doorrince ndrew stopped shortommander in hief utuzov said the newly arrived general speakingquickly with a harsh erman accent looking to both sides and advancingstraight toward the inner doorhe commanderinchief is engaged said ozlovski going hurriedly upto the unknown general and blocking his way to

calmlyhe generals face clouded his lips quivered and trembled e took outa notebook hurriedly scribbled something in pencil tore out the leafgave it to ozlovski stepped quickly to the window and threw himselfinto a chair gazing at those in the room as if asking hy do theylook at me hen he lifted his head stretched his neck as if heintended to say something but immediately with affected indifferencebegan to hum to himself producing a queer sound which immediately brokeoff he door of the private room opened and utuzov appeared in thedoorway he general with the bandaged head bent forward as thoughrunning away from some danger and making long quick strides with histhin legs went up to utuzovous voyez le malheureux ack he uttered in a broken voiceutuzovs face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectlyimmobile for a few moments hen wrinkles ran over his face like a waveand his forehead became smooth again he bowed his head respectfullyclosed his eyes silently let ack enter his room before him and closedthe door himself behind himhe report which had been circulated that the ustrians had been beatenand that the whole army had surrendered at lm proved to be correctithin half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions withorders which showed that the ussian troops who had hitherto beeninactive would also soon have to meet the enemyrince ndrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interestlay in the general progress of the war hen he saw ack and heard thedetails of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lostunderstood all the difficulties of the ussian armys position andvividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to playnvoluntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of thehumiliation of arrogant ustria and that in a weeks time he mightperhaps see and take part in the first ussian encounter with therench since uvorov met them e feared that onapartes genius mightoutweigh all the courage of the ussian troops and at the same timecould not admit the idea of his hero being disgracedxcited and irritated by these thoughts rince ndrew went toward hisroom to write to his father to whom he wrote every day n the corridorhe met esvitski with whom he shared a room and the wag herkov theywere as usual laughinghy are you so glum asked esvitski noticing rince

gives him one in the teeth with the butt endof his gun a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gailywith a wide swing of his armes the ham was just delicious answered another with a loud laughnd they too passed on so that esvitski did not learn who had beenstruck on the teeth or what the ham had to do with itah ow they scurry e just sends a ball and they think theyll allbe killed a

ogdanich was only pretending not tonotice him and that his whole aim now was to test the cadets courageso he drew himself up and looked around him merrily then it seemed tohim that ogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage exthe thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attackjust to punish himostov hen he imagined how after the attackogdanich would come up to

his enemythe colonel closelyto find in his face confirmation of his ownconjecture but the colonel did not once glance at ostov and looked ashe always did when at the front solemn and stern hen came the word ofcommandook sharp ook sharp several voices repeated around himheir sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling thehussars hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do he menwere crossing themselves ostov no longer looked at the colonel he hadno time e was afraid of falling behind the hussars so much afraidthat his heart stood still is hand trembled as he gave his

spurs catchingand their sabers clatteringtretchers shouted someone behind himostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant he ran ontrying only to be ahead of the others but just at the bridge notlooking at the ground he came on some sticky trodden mud stumbledand fell on his hands he others outstripped himt boss zides aptain he heard the voice of the colonel who havingridden ahead had pulled up his horse near the bridge with atriumphant cheerful faceostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy andwas about to run on thinking that the farther he went to the front thebetter ut ogdanich without looking at or recognizing ostov shoutedto himhos that running on the middle of the bridge o the right omeback adet he cried angrily and turning to enisov who showing offhis courage had ridden on to the planks of the bridgehy run risks aptain ou should dismount he saidh every bullet has its billet answered aska enisov turning inhis saddleeanwhile esvitski herkov and the officer of the suite were standingtogether out of range of the shots watching now the small group of menwith yellow shakos darkgreen jackets braided with cord and blueriding breeches who were swarming near the bridge and then at what wasapproaching in the distance from the opposite sidethe blue uniformsand groups with horses easily recognizable as artilleryill they burn the bridge or not holl get there first ill they getthere and fire the bridge or will the rench get within grapeshot rangeand wipe them out hese were the questions each man of the troops onthe high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with asinking heartwatching the bridge and the hussars in the bright eveninglight and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with theirbayonets and gunsgh he hussars will get it hot said esvitski they are withingrapeshot range nowe shouldnt have taken so many men said the officer of the suiterue enough answered esvitski two smart fellows could have donethe job just as wellh your excellency put in herkov his eyes fixed on the hussarsbut still with that naive air that made it impossible to know whether hewas speaking in jest or in earnest h your excellency ow you lookat things end two men nd who then would give us the ladimir medaland ribbon ut now even if they do get peppered the squadron may berecommended for honors and he may get a ribbon

rench guns were hastily reloaded he infantry in their blueuniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run moke appeared again butat irregular intervals and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto thebridge ut this time esvitski could not see what was happening thereas a dense cloud of smoke arose from it he hussars had succeeded insetting it on fire and the rench batteries were now firing at them nolonger to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there wassomeone to fire athe rench had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussarsgot back to their horses wo were misdirected and the shot went toohigh but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars andknocked three of them overostov absorbed by his relations with ogdanich had paused on thebridge not knowing what to do here was no one to hew down as he hadalways imagined battles to himself nor could he help to fire thebridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like theother soldiers e stood looking about him when suddenly he heard arattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt and the hussar nearestto him fell against the rails with a groan ostov ran up to him withthe others gain someone shouted tretchers our men seized thehussar and began lifting himooh or hrists sake let me alone cried the wounded man but stillhe was lifted and laid on the stretchericholas ostov turned away and as if searching for something gazedinto the distance at the waters of the anube at the sky and at thesun ow beautiful the sky looked how blue how calm and how deep owbright and glorious was the setting sun ith what soft glitter thewaters of the distant anube shone nd fairer still were the farawayblue mountains beyond the river the nunnery the mysterious gorges andthe pine forests veiled in

equipmenthere had been actions at ambach mstetten and elk but despite thecourage and enduranceacknowledged even by the enemywith which theussians fought the only consequence of these actions was a yet morerapid retreat ustrian troops that had escaped capture at lm and hadjoined utuzov at raunau now separated from the ussian army andutuzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces

extraordinary clearness andrapidity e again vividly recalled the details of the battle no longerdim but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himselfstating them to the mperor rancis e vividly imagined the casualquestions that might be put to him and the answers he would give eexpected to be at once presented to the mperor t the chief entranceto the palace however an official came running out to meet him andlearning that he was a special messenger led him to another entranceo the right from the corridor uer ochgeboren here you will findthe adjutant on duty said the official e

ussian messengerrince ndrews joyous feeling was considerably weakened as heapproached the door of the ministers room e felt offended andwithout his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned intoone of disdain which was quite uncalled for is fertile mind instantlysuggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise theadjutant and the minister way from the smell of powder they probablythink it easy to gain victories he thought is eyes narroweddisdainfully he entered the room of the inister of ar with peculiarlydeliberate steps his feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw theminister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencilnotes on them and for the first two or three minutes taking no noticeof his arrival  wax candle stood at each side of the ministers bentbald head with its gray temples e went on reading to the end withoutraising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footstepsake this and deliver it said he to his adjutant handing him thepapers and still taking no notice of the special messengerrince ndrew felt that either the actions of utuzovs army interestedthe inister of ar less than any of the other matters he was concernedwith or he wanted to give the ussian special messenger thatimpression ut that is a matter of perfect indifference to me hethought he minister drew the remaining papers together arranged themevenly and then raised his head e had an intellectual and distinctivehead but the instant he turned to rince ndrew the firm intelligentexpression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate andhabitual to him is face took on the stupid artificial smile whichdoes not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a man who iscontinually receiving many petitioners one after

he had been deprived ofall the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life rincendrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings suchas he had been accustomed to from childhood esides it was pleasantafter his reception by the ustrians to speak if not in ussian forthey were speaking rench at least with a ussian who would hesupposed share the general ussian antipathy

intimate when rince ndrew was in ienna with utuzovust as rince ndrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high inthe military profession so to an even greater extent ilibin gavepromise of rising in his diplomatic career e still a young man but nolonger a young diplomat as he had entered the service at the age ofsixteen had been in aris and openhagen and now held a ratherimportant post in ienna oth the foreign minister and our ambassadorin ienna knew him and valued him e was not one of those manydiplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualitiesavoid doing certain

he liked work only when it could be madeelegantly witty n society he always awaited an opportunity to saysomething striking and took part in a conversation only when that waspossible is conversation was always sprinkled with wittily originalfinished phrases of general interest hese sayings were prepared in theinner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally sothat insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room todrawing room nd in fact ilibins witticisms were hawked about inthe iennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on mattersconsidered importantis

matter for great rejoicing and that you cant bereceived as a savioreally  dont care about that  dont care at all said rincendrew beginning to understand that his news of the battle before remswas really of small importance in view of such events as the fall ofustrias capital ow is it ienna was taken hat of the bridge andits celebrated bridgehead and rince uersperg e heard reports thatrince uersperg was defending ienna he saidrince uersperg is on this on our side of the river and is defendingusdoing it very badly  think but still he is defending us utienna is on the other side o the bridge has not yet been taken and hope it will not be for it is mined and orders have been given to blowit up therwise we should long ago have been in the mountains ofohemia and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hourbetween two firesut still this does not mean that the campaign is over said rincendrewell  think it is he bigwigs here think so too but they darentsay so t will be as  said at the beginning of the campaign it wontbe your skirmishing at urrenstein or gunpowder at all that willdecide the matter but those who devised it said ilibin quoting oneof his own mots releasing the wrinkles on his forehead and pausinghe only question is what will come of the meeting between the mperorlexander and the ing of russia in erlin f russia joins thellies ustrias hand

the renchinvoluntarily so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be tounload the muskets explode the ammunition and all return home asquickly as possibleut the guns remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses andentrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannonconfronted one another as before aving ridden round the whole line from right flank to left rincendrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer hadtold him the whole field could be seen ere he dismounted and stoppedbeside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon efore the guns anartillery sentry was pacing up and down he stood at attention when theofficer arrived but at a sign resumed his measured monotonous pacingehind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropesand artillerymens bonfires o the left not far from the farthestcannon was a small newly constructed wattle shed from which came thesound of officers voices in eager conversationt was true that a view over nearly the whole ussian position and thegreater part of the enemys opened out from this battery ust facingit on the crest of the opposite hill the village of chon raberncould be seen and in three places to left and right the rench troopsamid the smoke of their campfires the greater part of whom wereevidently in the village itself and behind the hill o the left fromthat village amid the smoke was something resembling a battery but itwas impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye ur right flank wasposted on a rather steep incline which dominated the rench positionur infantry were stationed there and at the farthest point thedragoons n the center where ushins battery stood and from whichrince ndrew was surveying the position was the easiest and mostdirect descent and ascent to the brook separating us from chon rabernn the left our troops were close to a copse in which smoked thebonfires of our infantry who were felling wood he rench line waswider than ours and it was plain that they could easily outflank us onboth sides ehind our position was a steep and deep dip making itdifficult for artillery and cavalry to retire rince ndrew took outhis notebook and leaning on the cannon sketched a plan of theposition e made some notes on two points intending to mention them toagration is idea was first to concentrate all the artillery in thecenter and secondly to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of thedip rince ndrew being always near the commander in chief closelyfollowing the mass movements and general orders and constantly studyinghistorical accounts of battles involuntarily pictured to himself thecourse of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline e imaginedonly important possibilities f the enemy attacks the right flank hesaid to himself the iev grenadiers and the odolsk chasseurs musthold their position till reserves from the center come up n that casethe dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack f theyattack our center we having the center battery on this high groundshall withdraw the left flank under its cover and retreat to the dip byechelons o he reasoned ll the time he had been beside the gunhe had heard the voices of the officers distinctly but as often happenshad not understood a word of what they were saying uddenly howeverhe was struck by a voice coming from the shed and its tone was sosincere that he could not but listeno friend said a pleasant and as it seemed to rince ndrew afamiliar voice what  say is that if it were possible to know what isbeyond death none of us would be afraid of it hats so friendnother a younger voice interrupted him fraid or not you cantescape it anyhowll the same one is afraid h you clever people said a third manlyvoice interrupting them both f course you artillery men are verywise because you can take everything along with youvodka and snacksnd the owner of the manly voice evidently an infantry officerlaughedes one is afraid continued the first speaker he of the familiarvoice ne is afraid of the unknown thats what it is hatever we maysay about the soul going to the sky we know there is no sky but onlyan atmospherehe manly voice again

louder louder and faster a cannon ball as if ithad not finished saying what was necessary thudded into the ground nearthe shed with super human force throwing up a mass of earth he groundseemed to groan at the terrible impactnd immediately ushin with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth andhis kind intelligent face rather pale rushed out of the shed followedby the owner of the manly voice a dashing infantry officer who hurriedoff to his company buttoning up his coat as he ran ounting his horse again rince ndrew lingered with the batterylooking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball is eyes ranrapidly over the wide space but he only saw that the hithertomotionless masses of the rench now swayed and that there really was abattery to their left he smoke above it had not yet dispersed womounted renchmen probably adjutants were galloping up the hill small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hillprobably to strengthen the front line he smoke of the first shot hadnot yet dispersed before another puff appeared followed by a reporthe battle had begun rince ndrew turned his horse and galloped backto runth to find rince agration e heard the cannonade

present itselfassing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinkingvodka a quarter of an hour before he saw everywhere the same rapidmovement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready andon all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled hisheart t has begun ere it is dreadful but enjoyable was what theface of each soldier and each officer seemed to sayefore he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up he sawin the light of the dull autumn evening mounted men coming toward himhe foremost wearing a ossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding awhite horse was rince agration rince ndrew stopped waiting forhim to come up rince agration reined in his horse and recognizingrince ndrew nodded to him e still looked ahead while rince ndrewtold him what he had seenhe feeling t has begun ere it is was seen even on rinceagrations hard brown face with its halfclosed dull sleepy eyesrince ndrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face andwished he could tell what if anything this man was thinking andfeeling at that moment s there anything at all behind that impassiveface rince ndrew asked himself as he looked rince agration benthis head in sign of agreement with what rince ndrew told him andsaid ery good in a tone that seemed to imply that everything thattook place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseenrince ndrew out of breath with his rapid ride spoke quickly rinceagration uttering his words with an riental accent spokeparticularly slowly as if to impress the fact that there was no need tohurry owever he put his horse to a trot in the direction of ushinsbattery rince ndrew followed with the suite ehind rince agrationrode an officer of the suite the princes personal adjutant herkovan orderly officer the staff officer on duty riding a fine bobtailedhorse and a civilianan accountant who had asked permission to bepresent at the battle out of curiosity he accountant a stout fullfaced man looked around him with a naive smile of satisfaction andpresented a strange appearance among the hussars ossacks andadjutants in his camlet coat as he jolted on his horse with a convoyofficers saddlee wants to see a battle said herkov to olkonski pointing to theaccountant but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach alreadyh leave off said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunningsmile as if flattered at being made the subject of herkovs joke andpurposely trying to appear stupider than he really wast is very strange mon onsieur rince said the staff officer eremembered that in rench there is some peculiar way of addressing aprince but could not get it quite righty this time they were all approaching ushins battery and a ballstruck the ground in front of themhats that that has fallen asked the accountant with a naive smile rench pancake answered herkovo thats what they hit with asked the accountant ow awfule seemed to swell with satisfaction e had hardly finished speakingwhen they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenlyended with a thud into something soft ffflop and a ossack ridinga little to their right and behind the accountant crashed to earth withhis horse herkov and the staff officer bent over their saddles andturned their horses away he accountant stopped facing the ossackand examined him with attentive curiosity he ossack was dead but thehorse still struggledrince agration screwed up his eyes looked round and seeing thecause of the confusion turned away with indifference as if to say sit worth while noticing trifles e reined in his horse with the careof a skillful rider and slightly bending over disengaged his saberwhich had caught in his cloak t was an oldfashioned saber of a kindno longer in general use rince ndrew remembered the story of uvorovgiving his saber to agration in taly and the recollection wasparticularly pleasant at that moment hey had reached the battery atwhich rince ndrew had been when he examined the battlefieldhose company asked rince agration of an artilleryman standing bythe ammunition wagone asked hose company but he really meant re you frightenedhere and the artilleryman understood himaptain ushins your excellency shouted the redhaired freckledgunner in a merry voice standing to attentiones yes muttered agration as if considering something and he rodepast the limbers to the farthest cannons he approached a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and hissuite and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could seethe gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to itsformer position  huge broadshouldered gunner umber ne holding amop his legs far apart sprang to the wheel while umber wo with atrembling hand placed a charge in the cannons mouth he short roundshouldered aptain ushin stumbling over the tail of the gun carriagemoved forward and not noticing the general looked out shading his eyeswith his small handift it two lines more and it will be just right cried he in a feeblevoice to which he tried to impart a dashing note illsuited to his weakfigure umber wo he squeaked ire edvedevagration called to him and ushin raising three fingers to his capwith a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute butlike a priests benediction approached the general hough ushinsguns had been intended to cannonade the valley he was firing incendiaryballs at the village of chon rabern visible just opposite in front ofwhich large masses of rench were advancingo one had given ushin orders where and at what to fire but afterconsulting his sergeant major akharchenko for whom he had greatrespect he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to thevillage ery good said agration in reply to the officers reportand began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended beforehim he rench had advanced nearest on our right elow the height onwhich the iev regiment was stationed in the hollow where the rivuletflowed the soulstirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heardand much farther to the right beyond the dragoons the officer of thesuite pointed out to agration a rench column that was outflanking uso the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood rince agrationordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the rightflank he officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that ifthese battalions went away the guns would remain without supportrince agration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked athim in silence t seemed to rince ndrew that the officers remark wasjust and that really no answer could be made to it ut at that momentan adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of theregiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the rench werecoming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and wasretreating upon the iev grenadiers rince agration bowed his head insign of assent and approval e rode off at a walk to the right and sentan adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the rench ut thisadjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander ofthe dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground as aheavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly andso had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the woodery good said agrations he was leaving the battery firing was heard on the left also and asit was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go therehimself rince agration sent herkov to tell the general in commandthe one who had paraded his regiment before utuzov at raunau that hemust retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear asthe right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemysattack very long bout ushin and the battalion that had been insupport of his battery all was forgotten rince ndrew listenedattentively to agrations colloquies with the commanding officers andthe orders he gave them and to his surprise found that no orders werereally given but that rince agration tried to make it appear thateverything done by necessity by accident or by the will of subordinatecommanders was done if not by his direct command at least in accordwith his intentions rince ndrew noticed however that though whathappened was due to chance and was independent of the commanders willowing to the tact agration showed his presence was very valuablefficers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calmsoldiers and officers greeted him gaily grew more cheerful in hispresence and were evidently anxious to display their courage beforehim rince agration having reached the highest point of our right flankbegan riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but whereon account of the smoke nothing could be seen he nearer they got tothe hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearnessof the actual battlefield hey began to meet wounded men ne with ableeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers whosupported him under the arms here was a gurgle in his throat and hewas spitting blood  bullet had evidently hit him in the throat ormouth nother was walking sturdily by himself but without his musketgroaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt whileblood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle e hadthat moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than sufferingrossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lyingon the ground they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom wereunwounded he soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily anddespite the generals presence were talking loudly and gesticulating nfront of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through thesmoke and an officer catching sight of agration rushed shouting afterthe crowd of retreating soldiers ordering them back agration rode upto the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there drowningthe sound of voices and the shouts of command he whole air reeked withsmoke he excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it omewere using their ramrods others putting powder on the touchpans ortaking charges from their pouches while others were firing though whothey were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was nowind to carry away  pleasant humming and whistling of bullets wereoften heard hat is this thought rince ndrew approaching the crowdof soldiers t cant be an attack for they are not moving it cantbe a squarefor they are not drawn up for thathe commander of the regiment a thin feeblelooking old man with apleasant smilehis eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyesgiving him a mild expression rode up to agration and welcomed him as ahost welcomes an honored guest e reported that his regiment had beenattacked by rench cavalry and that though the attack had beenrepulsed he had lost more than half his men e said the attack hadbeen repulsed employing this military term to describe what hadoccurred to his regiment but in reality he did not himself know whathad happened during that halfhour to the troops entrusted to him andcould not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or hisregiment had been broken up ll he knew was that at the commencement ofthe action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment andhitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted avalry and ourmen had begun firing hey were still firing not at the cavalry whichhad disappeared but at rench infantry who had come into the hollow andwere firing at our men rince agration bowed his head as a sign thatthis was exactly what he had desired and expected urning to hisadjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the ixthhasseurs whom they had just passed rince ndrew was struck by thechanged expression on rince agrations face at this moment texpressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of aman who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the waterhe dull sleepy expression was no longer there nor the affectation ofprofound thought he round steady hawks eyes looked before himeagerly and rather disdainfully not resting on anything although hismovements were still slow and measuredhe commander of the regiment turned to rince agration entreating himto go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were leaseyour excellency for ods sake he kept saying glancing for supportat an officer of the suite who turned away from him here you seeand he drew attention to the bullets whistling singing and hissingcontinually around them e spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproachthat a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax e areused to it but you sir will blister your hands e spoke as if thosebullets could not kill him and his halfclosed eyes gave still morepersuasiveness to his words he staff officer joined in the colonelsappeals but agration did not reply he only gave an order to ceasefiring and reform so as to give room for the two approachingbattalions hile he was speaking the curtain of smoke that hadconcealed the hollow driven by a rising wind began to move from rightto left as if drawn by an invisible hand and the hill opposite withthe rench moving about on it opened out before them ll eyes fastenedinvoluntarily on this rench column

halted insilence here was nothing fresh to be seen from the line for fromwhere they had been before it had been evident that it was impossiblefor cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground as

superfluous washanging on his benumbed left arm he wrist felt as if it were not hise examined his hand carefully vainly trying to find blood on it hhere are people coming he thought joyfully seeing some men runningtoward him hey will help me n front came a man wearing a strangeshako and a blue cloak swarthy sunburned and with a hooked nose hencame two more and many more running behind ne of them said somethingstrange not in ussian n among the hindmost of these men wearingsimilar shakos was a ussian hussar e was being held by the arms andhis horse was being led behind himt must be one of ours a prisoner es an it be that they will takeme too ho are these men thought ostov scarcely believing his eyesan they be rench e looked at the approaching renchmen and thoughbut a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack themto pieces their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believehis eyes ho are they hy are they running an they be coming at mend why o kill me e whom everyone is so fond of e remembered hismothers love for him and his familys and his friends and theenemys intention to kill him seemed impossible ut perhaps they maydo it or more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot orrealizing the situation he foremost renchman the one with the hookednose was already so close that the expression of his face could beseen nd the excited alien face of that man his bayonet hanging downholding his breath and running so lightly frightened ostov e seizedhis pistol and instead of firing it flung it at the renchman and ranwith all his might toward the bushes e did not now run with thefeeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the nns bridgebut with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds ne singlesentiment that of fear for his young and happy life possessed hiswhole being apidly leaping the furrows he fled across the field withthe impetuosity he used to show at catchplay now and then turning hisgoodnatured pale young face to look back  shudder of terror wentthrough him o better not look he thought but having reached thebushes he glanced round once more he rench had fallen behind andjust as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk andturning shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back ostovpaused o theres some mistake thought he hey cant have wantedto kill me ut at the same time his left arm felt as heavy as if aseventypound weight were tied to it e could run no more herenchman also stopped and took aim ostov closed his eyes and stoopeddown ne bullet and then another whistled past him e mustered hislast remaining strength took hold of his left hand with his right andreached the bushes ehind these were some ussian sharpshooters he infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts ofthe wood ran out of it the different companies getting mixed andretreated as a disorderly crowd ne soldier in his fear uttered thesenseless cry ut off that is so terrible in battle and that wordinfected the whole crowd with a feeling of panicurrounded ut off ere lost shouted the fugitiveshe moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind the generalrealized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment and thethought that he an exemplary officer of many years service who hadnever been to blame might be held responsible at headquarters fornegligence or inefficiency so staggered him that forgetting therecalcitrant cavalry colonel his own dignity as a general and aboveall quite forgetting the danger and all regard for selfpreservation heclutched the crupper of his saddle and spurring his horse galloped tothe regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around but fortunatelymissed him is one desire was to know what was happening and at anycost correct or remedy the mistake if he had made one so that he anexemplary officer of twentytwo years service who had never beencensured should not be held to blameaving galloped safely through the rench he reached a field behind thecopse across which our men regardless of orders were running anddescending the valley hat moment of moral hesitation which decides thefate of battles had arrived ould this disorderly crowd of soldiersattend to the voice of their commander or would they disregarding himcontinue their flight espite his desperate shouts that used to seem soterrible to the soldiers despite his furious purple countenancedistorted out of all likeness to his former self and the flourishing ofhis saber the soldiers all continued to run talking firing into theair and disobeying orders he moral hesitation which decided the fateof battles was evidently culminating in a paniche general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of thepowder smoke and stopped in despair verything seemed lost ut at thatmoment the rench who were attacking suddenly and without any apparentreason ran back and disappeared from the outskirts and ussiansharpshooters showed themselves in the copse t

continued firing and was only notcaptured by the rench because the enemy could not surmise that anyonecould have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefendedguns n the contrary the energetic action of that battery led therench to suppose that herein the centerthe main ussian forces wereconcentrated wice they had attempted to attack this point but on eachoccasion had been driven

reflected ontheirswing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration andactivity ushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense offear and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded neveroccurred to him n the contrary he became more and more elated tseemed to him that it was a very long time ago almost a day since hehad first seen the enemy and fired the first shot and that the cornerof the field he stood on was wellknown and familiar ground hough hethought of everything considered everything and did everything thebest of officers could do in his position he was in a state akin tofeverish delirium or drunkennessrom the deafening sounds of his own guns around him the whistle andthud of the enemys cannon balls from the flushed and perspiring facesof the crew bustling round the guns from the sight of the blood of menand horses from the little puffs of smoke on the enemys side alwaysfollowed by a ball flying past and striking the earth a man a gun ahorse from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his ownhad taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded himpleasure he enemys guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes fromwhich occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smokerhere hes puffing again muttered ushin to himself as a smallcloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by thewindow look out for

aptain ushin aptainushin turned round in dismay t was the staff officer who had turnedhim out of the booth at runth e was shouting in a gasping voicere you mad ou have twice been ordered to retreat and youhy are they down on me thought ushin looking in alarm at hissuperior dont he muttered holding up two fingers to his cap ut the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say  cannonball flying close to him caused him to duck and bend over his horsee paused and just as he was about to say something more another ballstopped him e turned his horse and galloped offetire ll to retire he shouted from a distancehe soldiers laughed  moment later an adjutant arrived with the sameordert was rince ndrew he first thing he saw on riding up to the spacewhere ushins guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with abroken leg that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horseslood was gushing from its leg as from a spring mong the limbers layseveral dead men ne ball after another passed over as he approachedand he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine ut the mere thoughtof being afraid roused him again  cannot be afraid thought he anddismounted slowly among the guns e delivered the order and did notleave the battery e decided to have the guns removed from theirpositions and withdrawn in his presence ogether with ushin steppingacross the bodies and under a terrible fire from the rench he attendedto the removal of the guns staff officer was here a minute ago but skipped off said anartilleryman to rince ndrew ot like your honorrince ndrew said nothing to ushin hey

more conspicuous hecannonade was dying down but the rattle of musketry behind and on theright sounded oftener and nearer s soon as ushin with his gunscontinually driving round or coming upon wounded men was out of rangeof fire and had descended into the dip he was met by some of the staffamong them the staff officer and herkov who had been twice sent toushins battery but had never reached it

reached the village of runtersdorf they halted thad grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten pacesoff and the firing had begun to subside uddenly near by on theright shouting and

as at those who were laughing among whom herkov laughedloudestnly now when he was confronted by the stern authorities did his guiltand the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive

lower jawtrembling and was hardly able to mutter  dont know yourexcellency  had no men your excellencyou might have taken some from the covering troopsushin did not say that there were no covering

ofgentleness and affection e could not refuse the post or rather therank for he did nothing that rince asili had procured for him andacquaintances invitations and social occupations were so numerousthat even more than in oscow he felt a sense of bewilderment bustleand continual expectation of some good always in front of him but neverattainedf his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in etersburghe uards had gone to the front olokhov had been reduced to theranks natole was in the army somewhere in the provinces rince ndrewwas abroad so ierre had not the opportunity to

spent chiefly at rince asilishouse in the company of the stout princess his wife and his beautifuldaughter eleneike the others nna avlovna cherer showed ierre the change ofattitude toward him that had taken place in societyormerly in nna avlovnas presence ierre had always felt that whathe was saying was out of place tactless and unsuitable that remarkswhich seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolishas soon as he uttered them while on the contrary ippolytes stupidestremarks came out clever and apt ow everything ierre said wascharmant ven if nna avlovna did not say so he could see that shewished to and only refrained out of regard for his modestyn the beginning of the winter of  ierre received one of nnaavlovnas usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added ouwill find the beautiful elene here whom it is always delightful toseehen he read that sentence ierre felt for the first time that somelink which other people recognized had grown up between himself andelene and that thought both alarmed him as if some obligation werebeing imposed on him which he could not fulfill and pleased him as anentertaining suppositionnna avlovnas t ome was like the former one only the novelty sheoffered her guests this time was not ortemart but a diplomatist freshfrom erlin with the very latest details of the mperor lexandersvisit to otsdam and of how the two august friends had pledgedthemselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justiceagainst the enemy of the human race nna avlovna received ierre witha shade of melancholy evidently relating to the young mans recent lossby the death of ount ezukhov everyone constantly considered it a dutyto assure ierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of thefather he had hardly known and her melancholy was just like the augustmelancholy she showed at the mention of her most august ajesty thempress arya edorovna ierre felt flattered by this nna avlovnaarranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitualskill he large group in which were rince asili and the generalshad the benefit of the diplomat nother group was at the tea tableierre wished to join the former but nna avlovnawho was in theexcited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands ofnew and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put inactionseeing ierre touched his sleeve with her finger sayingait a bit  have something in view for you this evening heglanced at elene and smiled at her y dear elene be charitable tomy poor aunt who adores you o and keep her company for ten minutesnd that it will not be too dull here is the dear count who will notrefuse to accompany youhe beauty went to the aunt but nna avlovna detained ierre lookingas if she had to give some final necessary instructionssnt she exquisite she said to ierre pointing to the statelybeauty as she glided away nd how she carries herself or so young agirl such tact such masterly perfection of manner t comes from herheart appy the man who wins her ith her the least worldly of menwould occupy a most brilliant position in society ont you think so only wanted to know your opinion and nna avlovna let ierre goierre in reply sincerely agreed with her as to elenes perfection ofmanner f he ever thought of elene it was just of her beauty and herremarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in societyhe old aunt received the two young people in her corner but seemeddesirous of hiding her adoration for elene and inclined rather to showher fear of nna avlovna he looked at her niece as if inquiring whatshe was to do with these people n leaving them nna avlovna againtouched ierres sleeve saying  hope you wont say that it is dullin my house again and she glanced at eleneelene smiled with a look implying that she did not admit thepossibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted he auntcoughed swallowed and said in rench that she was very pleased to seeelene then she turned to ierre with the same words of welcome and thesame look n the middle of a dull and halting conversation eleneturned to ierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave toeveryone ierre was so used to that smile and it had so little meaningfor him that he paid no attention to it he aunt was just speaking ofa collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to ierres father ountezukhov and showed them her own box rincess elene asked to see theportrait of the aunts husband on the box lidhat is probably the work of inesse said ierre mentioning acelebrated miniaturist and he leaned over the table to take thesnuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other tablee half rose meaning to go round but the aunt handed him the snuffboxpassing it across elenes back elene stooped forward to make roomand looked round with a smile he was as always at evening partieswearing a dress such as was then fashionable cut very low at front andback er bust which had always seemed like marble to ierre was soclose to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive theliving charm of her neck and shoulders so near to his lips that he needonly have bent his head a little to have touched them e was consciousof the warmth of her body the scent of perfume and the creaking of hercorset as she moved e did not see her marble beauty forming a completewhole with her dress but all the charm of her body only covered by hergarments nd having once seen this he could not help being aware of itjust as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen througho you have never noticed before how beautiful  am elene seemed tosay ou had not noticed that  am a woman es  am a woman who maybelong to anyoneto you too said her glance nd at that momentierre felt that elene not only could but must be his wife and thatit could not be otherwisee knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at thealtar with her ow and when this would be he did not know he did noteven know if it would be a good thing he even felt he knew not whythat it would be a bad thing but he knew it would happenierre dropped his eyes lifted them again and wished once more to seeher as a distant beauty far removed from him as he had seen her everyday until then but he could no longer do it e could not any morethan a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through themist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he hasonce recognized it to be a tuft of grass he was terribly close to himhe already had power over him and between them there was no longer anybarrier except the barrier of his own willell  will leave you in your little corner came nna avlovnasvoice  see you are all right therend ierre anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anythingreprehensible looked round with a blush t seemed to him that everyoneknew what had happened to him as he knew it himself little later when he went up to the large circle nna avlovna saidto him  hear you are refitting your etersburg househis was true he architect had told him that it was necessary andierre without knowing why was having his enormous etersburg housedone uphats a good thing but dont move from rince asilis t is good tohave a friend like the prince she said smiling at rince asili know something about that ont  nd you are still so young ou needadvice ont be angry with me for exercising an old womans privilegehe paused as women always do expecting something after they havementioned their age f you marry it will be a different thing shecontinued uniting them both in one glance ierre did not look atelene nor she at him ut she was just as terribly close to him emuttered something and coloredhen he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of whathad happened hat had happened othing e had merely understood thatthe woman he had known as a child of whom when her beauty was mentionedhe had said absentmindedly es shes good looking he hadunderstood that this woman might belong to himut shes stupid  have myself said she is stupid he thought hereis something nasty something wrong in the feeling she excites in me have been told that her brother natole was in love with her and shewith him that there was quite a scandal and that thats why he was sentaway ippolyte is her brother rince asili is her father tsbad he reflected but while he was thinking this the reflectionwas still incomplete he caught himself smiling and was conscious thatanother line of thought had sprung up and while thinking of herworthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife how shewould love him become quite different and how all he had thought andheard of her might be false nd he again saw her not as the daughter ofrince asili but visualized her whole body only veiled by its graydress ut no hy did this thought never occur to me before andagain he told himself that it was impossible that there would besomething unnatural and as it seemed to him dishonorable in thismarriage e recalled her former words and looks and the words and looksof those who had seen them together e recalled nna avlovnas wordsand looks when she spoke to him about his house recalled thousands ofsuch hints from rince asili and others and was seized by terror lesthe had already in some way bound himself to do something that wasevidently wrong and that he ought not to do ut at the very time he wasexpressing this conviction to himself in another part of his mind herimage rose in all its womanly beauty n ovember  rince asili had to go on a tour of inspection infour different provinces e had arranged this for himself so as tovisit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son natolewhere his regiment was stationed and take him to visit rince icholasolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of thatrich old man ut before leaving home and undertaking these new affairsrince asili had to settle matters with ierre who it is true hadlatterly spent whole days at home that is in rince asilis housewhere he was staying and had been absurd excited and foolish inelenes presence as a lover should be but had not yet proposed toherhis is all very fine but things must be settled said rince asilito himself with a sorrowful sigh one morning feeling that ierre whowas under such obligations to him ut never mind that was notbehaving very well in this matter outh frivolity well od bewith him thought he relishing his own goodness of heart but it mustbe brought to a head he day after tomorrow will be elyas name day will invite two or three people and if he does not understand what heought to do then it will be my affairyes my affair  am her fatherix weeks after nna avlovnas t ome and after the sleepless nightwhen he had decided that to marry elene would be a calamity and that heought to avoid her and go away ierre despite that decision had notleft rince asilis and felt with terror that in peoples eyes he wasevery day more and more connected with her that it was impossible forhim to return to his former conception of her that he could not breakaway from her and that though it would be a terrible thing he wouldhave to unite his fate with hers e might perhaps have been able tofree himself but that rince asili who had rarely before givenreceptions now hardly let a day go by without having an evening partyat which ierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the generalpleasure and disappoint everyones expectation rince asili in therare moments when he was at home would take ierres hand in passingand draw it downwards or absentmindedly hold out his wrinkled cleanshaven cheek for ierre to kiss and would say ill tomorrow or ein to dinner or  shall not see you or  am staying in for yoursake and so on nd though rince asili when he stayed in as hesaid for ierres sake hardly exchanged a couple of words with himierre felt unable to disappoint him very day he said to himself oneand the same thing t is time  understood her and made up my mindwhat she really is as  mistaken before or am  mistaken now o sheis not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes said to himselfshe never makes a mistake never says anything stupid he says littlebut what she does say is always clear and simple so she is not stupidhe never was abashed and is not abashed now so she cannot be a badwoman e had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in hercompany and she had always answered him either by a brief butappropriate remarkshowing that it did not interest heror by a silentlook and smile which more palpably than anything else showed ierre hersuperiority he was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense incomparison with that smilehe always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for himalone in which there was something more significant than in the generalsmile that usually brightened her face ierre knew that everyone waswaiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line and he knew thatsooner or later he would step across it but an incomprehensible terrorseized him at the thought of that dreadful step  thousand times duringthat month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer tothat dreadful abyss ierre said to himself hat am  doing  needresolution an it be that  have nonee wished to take a decision but felt with dismay that in this matterhe lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and reallypossessed ierre was one of those who are only strong when they feelthemselves quite innocent and since that day when he was overpowered bya feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at nna avlovnasan unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his willn elenes name day a small party of just their own peopleas hiswife saidmet for supper at rince asilis ll these friends andrelations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girlwould be decided that evening he visitors were seated at supperrincess uragina a portly

younger and less important guests andthere too sat the members of the family and ierre and elene side byside rince asili was not having any supper he went round the tablein a merry mood sitting down now by one now by another of the guestso each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except toierre and elene whose presence he seemed not to notice e enlivenedthe whole party he wax candles burned brightly the silver and crystalgleamed so did the ladies toilets and the gold and silver of the mensepaulets servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table theclatter of plates knives and glasses mingled with the animated hum ofseveral conversations t one end of the table the old chamberlain washeard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately at whichshe laughed at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes ofsome ary iktorovna or other t the center of the table rince asiliattracted everybodys attention ith a facetious smile on his face hewas telling the ladies about last ednesdays meeting of the mperialouncil at which ergey uzmich yazmitinov the new military governorgeneral of etersburg had received and read the then famous rescript ofthe mperor lexander from the army to ergey uzmich in which themperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of thepeoples loyalty that the declaration from etersburg gave himparticular pleasure and that he was proud to be at the head of such anation and would endeavor to be worthy of it his rescript began withthe words ergey uzmich rom all sides reports reach me etcell and so he never got farther than ergey uzmich asked one ofthe ladiesxactly not a hairs breadth farther answered rince asililaughing ergey uzmich rom all sides rom all sides ergeyuzmich oor yazmitinov could not get any farther e began therescript again and again but as soon as he uttered ergey he sobbeduzmich tears and rom all sides was smothered in sobs and hecould get no farther nd again his handkerchief and again ergeyuzmich rom all sides and tears till at last somebody else wasasked to read ituzmich rom all sides and then tears someone repeatedlaughingont be unkind cried nna avlovna from her end of the table holdingup a threatening finger e is such a worthy and excellent man ourdear yazmitinovverybody laughed a great deal t the head of the table where thehonored guests sat everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under theinfluence of a variety of exciting sensations nly ierre and elenesat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table asuppressed smile brightening both their faces a smile that had nothingto do with ergey uzmicha smile of bashfulness at their own feelingsut much as all the rest laughed talked and joked much as theyenjoyed their hine wine saute and ices and however they avoidedlooking at the young couple and heedless and unobservant as they seemedof them one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that thestory about ergey uzmich the laughter and the food were all apretense and that the whole attention of that company was directed toierre and elene rince asili mimicked the sobbing of ergey uzmichand at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter and while helaughed the expression on his face clearly said es its gettingon it will all be settled today nna avlovna threatened him onbehalf of our dear yazmitinov and in her eyes which for aninstant glanced at ierre rince asili read a congratulation on hisfuture soninlaw and on his daughters happiness he old princesssighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her andglanced angrily at her daughter and her sigh seemed to say estheres nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine my dear nowthat the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldlyprovocatively happy nd what nonsense all this is that  am sayingthought a diplomatist glancing at the happy faces of the lovershats happinessnto the insignificant trifling and artificial

above all their affected chatterests fell flat news was not interesting and the animation wasevidently forced ot only the guests but even the footmen waiting attable seemed to feel this and they forgot their duties as they lookedat the beautiful elene with her radiant face and at the red broad andhappy though uneasy face of ierre t seemed as if the very light ofthe candles was focused on those two happy faces aloneierre felt that he was the center of it all and this both pleased andembarrassed him e was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupatione did not see hear or understand anything clearly nly now and thendetached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shotunexpectedly through his mindo it is all finished he thought nd how has it all happened owquickly ow  know that not because of her alone nor of myself alonebut because of everyone it must inevitably come about hey are allexpecting it they are so sure that it will happen that  cannot cannot disappoint them ut how will it be  do not know but it willcertainly happen thought ierre glancing at those dazzling shouldersclose to his eyesr he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what e felt itawkward to attract everyones attention and to be considered a lucky manand with his plain face to be looked on as a sort of aris possessedof a elen ut no doubt it always is and must be so he consoledhimself nd besides what have  done to bring it about ow did itbegin  traveled from oscow with rince asili hen there wasnothing o why should  not stay at his house hen  played cards withher and picked up her reticule and drove out with her ow did it beginwhen did it all come about nd here he was sitting by her side as herbetrothed seeing hearing feeling her nearness her breathing hermovements her beauty hen it would suddenly seem to him that it wasnot she but he was so unusually beautiful and that that was why theyall looked so at him and flattered by this general admiration he wouldexpand his chest raise his head and rejoice at his good fortuneuddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a secondtime ut ierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what wassaid am asking you when you last heard from olkonski repeated rinceasili a third time ow absentminded you are my dear fellowrince asili smiled and ierre noticed that everyone was smiling athim and elene ell what of it if you all know it thought ierrehat of it ts the truth and he himself smiled his gentle childlikesmile and elene smiled toohen did you get the letter as it from lmutz repeated rinceasili who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a disputeow can one talk or think of such trifles thought ierrees from lmutz he answered with a sighfter supper ierre with his partner followed the others into thedrawing room he guests began to disperse some without taking leave ofelene ome as if unwilling to distract her from an importantoccupation came up to her for a moment and made haste to go awayrefusing to let her see them off he diplomatist preserved a mournfulsilence as he left the drawing room e pictured the vanity of hisdiplomatic career in comparison with ierres happiness he old

ierre remained for a long timealone with elene in the little drawing room where they were sitting ehad often before during the last six weeks remained alone with herbut had never spoken to her of love ow he felt that it was inevitablebut he could not make up his mind to take the final step e feltashamed he felt that he was occupying someone elses place here besideelene his happiness is not for you some inner voice whispered tohim his happiness is for those who have not in them what there is inyouut as he had to say something he began by asking her whether she wassatisfied with the party he replied in her usual simple manner thatthis name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever hadome of the nearest relatives had not yet left hey were sitting in thelarge drawing room rince asili came up to ierre with languidfootsteps ierre rose and said it was getting late rince asili gavehim a look of stern inquiry as though what ierre had just said was sostrange that one could not take it in ut then the expression ofseverity changed and he drew ierres hand downwards made him sitdown and smiled affectionatelyell elya he asked turning instantly to his daughter andaddressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural toparents who have petted their children from babyhood but which rinceasili had only acquired by imitating other parentsnd he again turned to ierreergey uzmichrom all sides he said unbuttoning the top button ofhis waistcoatierre smiled but his smile showed that he knew it was not the storyabout ergey uzmich that interested rince asili just then and rinceasili saw that ierre knew this e suddenly muttered something andwent away t seemed to ierre that even the prince was disconcertedhe sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touchedierre he looked at elene and she too seemed disconcerted and herlook seemed to say ell it is your own faulthe step must be taken but  cannot  cannot thought ierre and heagain began speaking about indifferent matters about ergey uzmichasking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properlyelene answered with a smile that she too had missed ithen rince asili returned to the drawing room the princess his wifewas talking in low tones to the elderly lady about ierref course it is a very brilliant match but happiness my deararriages are made in heaven replied the elderly ladyrince asili passed by seeming not to hear the ladies and sat down ona sofa in a far corner of the room e closed his eyes and seemed to bedozing is head sank forward and then he roused himselfline he said to his wife go and see what they are abouthe princess went up to the door passed by it with a dignified andindifferent air and glanced into the little drawing room ierre andelene still sat talking just as beforetill the same she said to her husbandrince asili frowned twisting his mouth his cheeks quivered and hisface assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him hakinghimself

princess came in and also wept he elderly lady was using herhandkerchief too ierre was kissed and he kissed the beautifulelenes hand several times fter a while they were left alone againll this had to be and could not be otherwise thought ierre so itis useless to ask whether it is good or bad t is good because itsdefinite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt ierre held thehand of his betrothed in silence looking at her beautiful bosom as itrose and fellelene he said aloud and pausedomething special is always said in such cases he thought but couldnot remember what it was that people say e looked at her face hedrew nearer to him er face flushedh take those off those she said pointing to his spectaclesierre took them off and his eyes besides the strange look eyes havefrom which spectacles have just been removed had also a frightened andinquiring look e was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it butwith a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she intercepted hislips and met them with her own er face struck ierre by its alteredunpleasantly excited expressiont is too late now its done besides  love her thought ierree vous aime  he said remembering what has to be said at suchmoments but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself  love youix weeks later he was married and settled in ount ezukhovs largenewly furnished etersburg house the

changed intoa feeling of contemptuous ill will e snorted whenever he mentionedhim n the day of rince asilis arrival rince olkonski wasparticularly discontented and out of temper hether he was in a

trying to master her agitationhy did they write why did ise tell me about it t can neverhappen she said looking at herself in the glass ow shall  enterthe drawing room ven if  like him  cant now be myself with himhe mere thought of her fathers look filled her with terror he littleprincess and ademoiselle ourienne had already received from asha theladys maid the necessary report of how handsome the ministers sonwas with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows and with what difficultythe father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed himlike an eagle three steps at a time aving received this informationthe little princess and ademoiselle ourienne whose chattering voiceshad reached her from the corridor went into rincess arys roomou know theyve come arie said the little princess waddling inand sinking heavily into an armchairhe was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morningbut had on one of her best dresses er hair was carefully done and herface was animated which however did not conceal its sunken and fadedoutlines ressed as she used to be in etersburg society it was stillmore noticeable how much plainer she had become ome unobtrusive touchhad been added to ademoiselle ouriennes toilet which rendered herfresh and pretty face yet more attractivehat re you going to remain as you are dear princess she beganheyll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and weshall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself up at allhe little princess got up rang for the maid and hurriedly and merrilybegan to devise and carry out a plan of how rincess ary should bedressed rincess arys selfesteem was wounded by the fact that thearrival of a suitor agitated her and still more so by both hercompanions not having the least conception that it could be otherwiseo tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be tobetray her agitation while to decline their offers to dress her wouldprolong their banter and insistence he flushed her beautiful eyesgrew dim red blotches came on her face and it took on the unattractivemartyrlike expression it so often wore as she submitted herself toademoiselle ourienne and ise oth these women quite sincerely triedto make her look pretty he was so plain that neither of them couldthink of her as a rival so they began dressing her with perfectsincerity and with the naive and firm conviction women have that dresscan make a face prettyo really my dear this dress is not pretty said ise lookingsideways at rincess ary from a little distance ou have a maroondress have it fetched eally ou know the fate of your whole life maybe at stake ut this one is too light its not becomingt was not the dress but the face and whole figure of rincess arythat was not pretty but neither ademoiselle ourienne nor the littleprincess felt this they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placedin the hair the hair combed up and the blue scarf arranged lower onthe best maroon dress and so on all would be well hey forgot thatthe frightened face and the figure could not be altered and thathowever they might change the setting and adornment of that face itwould still remain piteous and plain fter two or three changes towhich rincess ary meekly submitted just as her hair had been arrangedon the top of her head a style that quite altered and spoiled herlooks and she had put on a maroon dress with a paleblue scarf thelittle princess walked twice round her now adjusting a fold of thedress with her little hand now arranging the scarf and looking at herwith her head bent first on one side and then on the othero it will not do she said decidedly clasping her hands o aryreally this dress does not suit you  prefer you in your little grayeveryday dress ow

becoming she saidhe three voices hers ademoiselle ouriennes and aties who waslaughing at something mingled in a merry sound like the chirping ofbirdso leave me alone said rincess aryer voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birdswas silenced at once hey looked at the beautiful large thoughtfuleyes full of tears and of thoughts gazing shiningly and imploringly atthem and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insistt least change your coiffure said the little princess idnt tell you she went on turning reproachfully to ademoiselle ouriennearys is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least otin the least lease change iteave me alone please leave me alone t is all quite the same to meanswered a voice struggling with tearsademoiselle ourienne and the little princess had to own to themselvesthat rincess ary in this guise looked very plain worse than usualbut it was too late he was looking at them with an expression theyboth knew an expression thoughtful and sad his expression in rincessary did not frighten them she never inspired fear in anyone but theyknew that when it appeared on her face she became mute and was not tobe shaken in her determinationou will change it wont you said ise nd as rincess ary gave noanswer she left the roomrincess ary was left alone he did not comply with ises requestshe not only left her hair as it was but did not even look in herglass etting her arms fall helplessly she sat with downcast eyes andpondered  husband a man a strong dominant and strangely attractivebeing rose in her imagination and carried her into a totally differenthappy world of his own he fancied a child her ownsuch as she hadseen the day before in the arms of her nurses daughterat her ownbreast the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and thechild ut no it is impossible  am too ugly she thoughtlease come to tea he prince will be out in a moment came themaids voice at the doorhe roused herself and felt appalled at what she had been thinking andbefore going down she went into the room where the icons hung and hereyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the aviour lit by alamp she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments  painfuldoubt filled her soul ould the joy of love of earthly love for a manbe for her n her thoughts of marriage rincess ary dreamed ofhappiness and of children but her strongest most deeply hidden longingwas for earthly love he more she tried to hide this feeling fromothers and even from herself the stronger it grew  od she saidhow am  to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil ow am to renounce forever these vile fancies so as peacefully to fulfill hywill nd scarcely had she put that question than od gave her theanswer in her own heart esire nothing for thyself seek nothing benot anxious or envious ans future and thy own fate must remain hiddenfrom thee but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything f it beods will to prove thee in the duties of marriage be ready to fulfillis will ith this consoling thought but yet with a hope for thefulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing rincess ary sighed andhaving crossed herself went down thinking neither of her gown andcoiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say hatcould all that matter in comparison with the will of od without hosecare not a hair of mans head can fall hen rincess ary came down rince asili and his son were already inthe drawing room talking to the little princess and ademoiselleourienne hen she entered with her heavy step treading on her heelsthe gentlemen and ademoiselle ourienne rose and the little princessindicating her to the gentlemen said oila arie rincess ary sawthem all and saw them in detail he saw rince asilis face seriousfor an instant at the sight of her but immediately smiling again andthe little princess curiously noting the impression arie produced onthe visitors nd she saw ademoiselle ourienne with her ribbon andpretty face and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him buthim she could not see she only saw something large brilliant andhandsome moving toward her as she entered the room rince asiliapproached first and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over herhand and answered his question by saying that on the contrary sheremembered him quite well hen natole came up to her he still couldnot see him he only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly and shetouched with her lips a white forehead over which was beautiful lightbrown hair smelling of pomade hen she looked up at him she was struckby his beauty natole stood with his right thumb under a button of hisuniform his chest expanded and his back drawn in slightly swinging onefoot and with his head a little bent looked with beaming face at theprincess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at allnatole was not quickwitted nor ready or eloquent in conversation buthe had the faculty so invaluable in society of composure andimperturbable selfpossession f a man lacking in selfconfidenceremains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of theimpropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say theeffect is bad ut natole was dumb swung his foot and smilinglyexamined the princess hair t was evident that he could be silent inthis way for a very long time f anyone finds this silenceinconvenient let him talk but  dont want to he seemed to sayesides this in his behavior to women natole had a manner whichparticularly inspires in them curiosity awe and even loveasupercilious consciousness of his own superiority t was as if he saidto them  know you  know you but why should  bother about yououd be only too glad of course erhaps he did not really think thiswhen he met womeneven probably he did not for in general he thoughtvery littlebut his looks and manner gave that impression he princessfelt this and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dareexpect to interest him she turned to his father he conversation wasgeneral and animated thanks to rincess ises voice and little downylip that lifted over her white teeth he met rince asili with thatplayful manner often employed by lively chatty people and consisting inthe assumption that between the person they so address and themselvesthere are some semiprivate longestablished jokes and amusingreminiscences though no such reminiscences really existjust as noneexisted in this case rince asili readily adopted her tone and thelittle princess also drew natole whom she hardly knew into theseamusing recollections of things that had never occurred ademoiselleourienne also shared them and even rincess ary felt herselfpleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscencesere at least we shall have the benefit of your company all toourselves dear prince said the little princess of course in renchto rince asili ts not as at nnettes  receptions where youalways ran away you remember cette chere nnette nna avlovnah but you wont talk politics to me like nnettend our little tea tableh yeshy is it you were never at nnettes the little princess askednatole h  know  know she said with a sly glance your brotherippolyte told me about your goings on h and she shook her finger athim  have even heard of your doings in arisnd didnt ippolyte tell you asked rince asili turning to his sonand seizing the little princess arm as if she would have run away andhe had just managed to catch her didnt he tell you how he himself waspining for the dear princess and how she showed him the door h sheis a pearl among women rincess he added turning to rincess aryhen aris was mentioned ademoiselle ourienne for her part seized theopportunity of joining in the general current of recollectionshe took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since natole hadleft aris and how he had liked that city natole answered therenchwoman very readily and looking at her with a smile talked to herabout her native land hen he saw the pretty little ourienne natolecame to the conclusion that he would not find ald ills dull eitherot at all bad he thought examining her not at all bad thatlittle companion  hope she will bring her along with her when weremarried la petite est gentille  he little one is charminghe old prince dressed leisurely in his study frowning and consideringwhat he was to do he coming of these visitors annoyed him hat arerince asili and that son of his to me rince asili is a shallowbraggart and his son no doubt is a fine specimen he grumbled tohimself hat angered him was that the coming of these visitors revivedin his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle one aboutwhich he always deceived himself he question was whether he could everbring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband heprince never directly asked himself that question knowing beforehandthat he would have to answer it justly and justice clashed not onlywith his feelings but with the very possibility of life ife withoutrincess ary little as he seemed to value her was unthinkable to himnd why should she marry he thought o be unhappy for certainheres ise married to ndrewa better husband one would think couldhardly be found nowadaysbut is she contented with her lot nd whowould marry arie for love lain and awkward heyll take her for herconnections and wealth re there no women living unmarried and eventhe happier for it o thought rince olkonski while dressing and yetthe question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answerrince asili had brought his son with the evident intention ofproposing and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answeris birth and position in society were not bad ell ve nothingagainst it the prince said to himself but he must be worthy of hernd that is what we shall seehat is what we shall see hat is what we shall see he added aloude entered the drawing room with his usual alert step glancing

well sees always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of timewithout male society on natoles appearance all the three women ofrince olkonskis household felt that their life had not been real tillthen heir powers of reasoning feeling and observing immediatelyincreased tenfold and their life which seemed to have been passed indarkness was suddenly lit up by a new brightness full of significancerincess ary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure hehandsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbedall her attention e seemed to her kind brave determined manly andmagnanimous he felt convinced of that housands of dreams of a futurefamily life continually rose in her imagination he drove them away andtried to conceal themut am  not too cold with him thought the princess  try to bereserved because in the depth of my soul  feel too near to him alreadybut then he cannot know what  think of him and may imagine that  donot like himnd rincess ary tried but could not manage to be cordial to her newguest oor girl shes devilish ugly thought natoleademoiselle ourienne also roused to great excitement by natolesarrival thought in another way f course she a handsome young womanwithout any definite position without relations or even a country didnot intend to devote her life to serving rince olkonski to readingaloud to him and being friends with rincess ary ademoiselleourienne had long been waiting for a ussian prince who able toappreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain badly dressedungainly ussian princesses would fall in love with her and carry heroff and here at last was a ussian prince ademoiselle ourienne knewa story heard from her aunt but finished in her own way which sheliked to repeat to herself t was the story of a girl who had beenseduced and to whom her poor mother sa pauvre mere appeared andreproached her for yielding to a man without being married ademoiselleourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told thisstory to him her seducer nd now he a real ussian prince hadappeared e would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would appearand he would marry her o her future shaped itself in ademoiselleouriennes head at the very time she was talking to natole aboutaris t was not calculation that guided her she did not even for amoment consider what she should do but all this had long been familiarto her and now that natole had appeared it just grouped itself aroundhim and she wished and tried to please him as much as possiblehe little princess like an old war horse that hears the trumpetunconsciously and quite forgetting her condition prepared for thefamiliar gallop of coquetry without any ulterior motive or anystruggle but with naive and lighthearted gaietylthough in female society natole usually assumed the role of a mantired of being run after by women his vanity was flattered by thespectacle of his power over these three women esides that he wasbeginning to feel for the pretty and provocative ademoiselle ouriennethat passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with greatsuddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actionsfter tea the company went into the sitting room and rincess ary wasasked to play on the clavichord natole laughing and in high spiritscame and leaned on his elbows facing her and beside ademoiselleourienne rincess ary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotioner favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and thelook she felt upon her made that world still more poetic ut natolesexpression though his eyes were fixed on her referred not to her butto the movements of ademoiselle ouriennes little foot which he wasthen touching with his own under the clavichord ademoiselle ouriennewas also looking at rincess ary and in her lovely eyes there was alook of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princessow she loves me thought rincess ary ow happy  am now and howhappy  may be with such a friend and such a husband usband an it bepossible she thought not daring to look at his face but stillfeeling his eyes gazing at hern the evening after supper when all were about to retire natolekissed rincess arys hand he did not know how she found the couragebut she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to hershortsighted eyes urning from rincess ary he went up and kissedademoiselle ouriennes hand his was not etiquette but then he dideverything so simply and with such assurance ademoiselle ourienneflushed and gave the princess a frightened lookhat delicacy thought the princess s it possible that melieademoiselle ourienne thinks  could be jealous of her and notvalue her pure affection and devotion to me he went up to her andkissed her warmly natole went up to kiss the little princess hando o o hen your father writes to tell me that you are behavingwell  will give you my hand to kiss ot till then she said ndsmilingly raising a finger at him she left the room hey all separated but except natole who fell asleep as soon as hegot into bed all kept awake a long time that nights he really to be my husband this stranger who is so kindyes kindthat is the chief thing thought rincess ary and fear which she hadseldom experienced came upon her he feared to look round it seemedto her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the darkcorner nd this someone was hethe deviland he was also this manwith the white forehead black eyebrows and red lipshe rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her roomademoiselle ourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a longtime that evening vainly expecting someone now smiling at someone nowworking herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mererebuking her for her fallhe little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly madehe could not lie either on her face or on her side very position wasawkward and uncomfortable and her burden oppressed her now more thanever because natoles presence had vividly recalled to her the timewhen she was not like that and when everything was light and gay hesat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and atie sleepyand disheveled beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the thirdtime muttering to herself told you it was all lumps and holes the little princess repeated should be glad enough to fall asleep so its not my fault and hervoice quivered like that of a child about to cryhe old prince did not sleep either ikhon half asleep heard himpacing angrily about and snorting he old prince felt as though he hadbeen insulted through his daughter he insult was the more pointedbecause it concerned not himself but another his daughter whom heloved more than himself e kept telling himself that he would considerthe whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act butinstead of that he only excited himself more and morehe first man that turns upshe forgets her father and everythingelse runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlikeherself lad to throw her father over nd she knew  should notice itr fr fr nd dont  see that that idiot had eyes only forourienne shall

and looks only at ourienne o she has no pride butll let her seehe old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making amistake and that natole meant to flirt with ademoiselle ouriennerincess arys selfesteem would be wounded and his point not to beparted from her would be gained so pacifying himself with thisthought he called ikhon and began to undresshat devil brought them here thought he while ikhon was putting thenightshirt over his driedup old body and grayhaired chest  neverinvited them hey came to disturb my lifeand there is not much of itleftevil take em he muttered while his head was still covered by theshirtikhon knew his masters habit of sometimes thinking aloud andtherefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression ofthe face that emerged from the shirtone to bed asked the princeikhon like all good valets instinctively knew the direction of hismasters thoughts e guessed that the question referred to rinceasili and his sonhey have gone to bed and put out their lights your excellencyo good no good said the prince rapidly and thrusting his feetinto his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown hewent to the couch on which he slepthough no words had passed between natole and ademoiselle ouriennethey quite understood one another as to the first part of their romanceup to the appearance of the pauvre mere they understood that they hadmuch to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking anopportunity since morning to meet one another alone hen rincess arywent to her fathers room at the usual hour ademoiselle ourienne andnatole met in the conservatoryrincess ary went to the door of the study with special trepidation tseemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would bedecided that day but that they also knew what she thought about it heread this in ikhons face and in that of rince asilis valet whomade her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot waterhe old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of hisdaughter that morning rincess ary well knew this painstakingexpression of her fathers is face wore that expression when his dryhands

lowered her eyes so as not to see the gazeunder which she felt that she could not think but would only be able tosubmit from habit and she said  wish only to do your will but if had to express my own desire he had no time to finish he oldprince interrupted herhats admirable he shouted e will take you with your dowry andtake ademoiselle ourienne into the bargain hell be the wife whileyouhe prince

pausedont come in she said to the old count who was following her omelater nd she went in closing the door behind herhe count put his ear to the keyhole and listenedt first he heard the sound of indifferent voices then nnaikhaylovnas voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silencethen both voices together with glad intonations and then footstepsnna ikhaylovna opened the door er face wore the proud expression ofa surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits thepublic to appreciate his skillt is done she said to the count pointing triumphantly to thecountess who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait andin the other the letter and pressing them alternately to her lipshen she saw the count she stretched out her arms to him embraced hisbald head

hear it had to come to the countess for she didnot let it out of her hands he tutors came and the nurses andmitri and several acquaintances and the countess reread the lettereach time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it freshproofs of ikolenkas virtues ow strange how extraordinary howjoyful it seemed that her son the scarcely perceptible motion of whosetiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her that son about whomshe used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count that son who hadfirst learned to say pear and then granny that this son should nowbe away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings a manly warriordoing some kind of mans work of his own without help or guidance heuniversal experience of ages showing that children do growimperceptibly from the cradle to manhood did not exist for thecountess er sons growth toward manhood at each of its stages hadseemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed themillions of human beings who grew up in the same way s twenty yearsbefore it seemed impossible that the little creature who livedsomewhere under her heart would ever cry suck her breast and begin tospeak so now she could not believe that that little creature could bethis strong brave man this model son and officer that judging by thisletter he now washat a style ow charmingly he describes said she reading thedescriptive

reached the rand uke in command of the uardsthere was no reason why it should not reach the avlograd regimentwhich was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood nd so it wasdecided to send the letters and money by the rand ukes courier tooris and oris was to forward them to icholas he letters were fromthe old count the countess etya era atasha and onya andfinally there were six thousand

how are you asked ostovell as you see o far everythings all right but  confess  shouldmuch like to be an adjutant and not remain at the fronthyecause when once a man starts on military service he should try tomake as successful a career of it as possibleh thats it said ostov evidently thinking of something elsee looked intently and inquiringly into his friends eyes evidentlytrying in vain to find the answer to some questionld abriel brought in the winehouldnt we now send for erg asked oris e would drink with you cantell send for him and how do you get on with that erman askedostov with a contemptuous smilee is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow answered orisgain ostov looked intently into oris eyes and sighed erg returnedand over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officersbecame animated he uardsmen told ostov of their march and how theyhad been made much of in ussia oland and abroad hey spoke of thesayings and doings of their commander the rand uke and told storiesof his kindness and irascibility erg as usual kept silent when thesubject did not relate to himself but in connection with the stories ofthe rand ukes quick temper he related with gusto how in alicia hehad managed to deal with the rand uke when the latter made a tour ofthe regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement ith apleasant smile erg related how the rand uke had ridden up to him in aviolent passion shouting rnauts rnauts was the sarevichsfavorite expression when he was in a rage and called for the companycommanderould you believe it ount  was not at all alarmed because  knew was right ithout boasting you know  may say that  know the rmyrders by heart and know the egulations as well as  do the ordsrayer o ount there never is any negligence in my company and somy conscience was at ease  came forward erg stood up and showedhow he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it wouldhave been difficult for a face to express greater respect and selfcomplacency than his did ell he stormed at me as the saying isstormed and stormed and stormed t was not a matter of life but ratherof death as the saying is lbanians and devils and oiberia said erg with a sagacious smile  knew  was in the rightso  kept silent was not that best ount ey are you dumb heshouted till  remained silent nd what do you think ount he nextday it was not even mentioned in the rders of the ay hats whatkeeping ones head means hats the way ount said erg lightinghis pipe and emitting rings of smokees that was fine said ostov smilingut oris noticed that he was preparing to make fun of erg andskillfully changed the subject e asked him to tell them how and wherehe got his wound his pleased ostov and he began talking about it andas he went on became more and more animated e told them of his chonrabern affair just as those who have taken part in a battle generallydo describe it that is as they would like it to have been as theyhave heard it described by others and as sounds well but not at all asit really was ostov was a truthful young man and would on no accounthave told a deliberate lie e began his story meaning to telleverything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily andinevitably he lapsed into falsehood f he had told the truth to hishearerswho like himself had often heard stories of attacks and hadformed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hearjust such a storythey would either not have believed him or stillworse would have thought that ostov was himself to blame since whatgenerally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happenedto him e could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot andthat he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard ashe could from a renchman into the wood esides to tell everything asit really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort ofwill to tell only what happened t is very difficult to tell the truthand young people are rarely capable of it is hearers expected a storyof how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had flown likea storm at the square cut his way in slashed right and left how hissaber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on nd so hetold them all thatn the middle of his story just as he was saying ou cannot imaginewhat a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack rince ndrewwhom oris was expecting entered the room rince ndrew who liked tohelp young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance andbeing well disposed toward oris who had managed to please him the daybefore he wished to do what the young man wanted aving been sent withpapers from utuzov to the sarevich he looked in on oris hoping tofind him alone hen he came in and saw an hussar of the line recountinghis military exploits rince ndrew could not endure that sort of manhe gave oris a pleasant smile frowned as with halfclosed eyes helooked at ostov bowed slightly and wearily and sat down languidly onthe sofa he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad companyostov flushed up on noticing this but he did not care this was a merestranger lancing however at oris he saw that he too seemed ashamedof the hussar of the linen spite of rince ndrews disagreeable ironical tone in spite of thecontempt with which ostov from his fighting army point of viewregarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomerwas evidently one ostov felt confused blushed and became silentoris inquired what news there might be on the staff and what withoutindiscretion one might ask about our planse shall probably advance replied olkonski evidently reluctant tosay more in the presence of a strangererg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as wasrumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would bedoubled o this rince ndrew answered with a smile that he could giveno opinion on such an important government order and erg laughedgailys to your business rince ndrew continued addressing oris wewill talk of it later and he looked round at ostov ome to meafter the review and we will do what is possiblend having glanced round the room rince ndrew turned to ostovwhose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing toanger he did not condescend to notice and said  think you weretalking of the chon rabern affair ere you there was there said ostov angrily as if intending to insult the aidedecampolkonski noticed the hussars state of mind and it amused him ith aslightly contemptuous smile he said es there are many stories nowtold about that affaires stories repeated ostov loudly looking with eyes suddenly grownfurious now at oris now at olkonski es many stories ut ourstories are the stories of men who have been under the enemys fire urstories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on thestaff who get rewards without doing anythingf whom you imagine me to be one said rince ndrew with a quiet andparticularly amiable smile strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this mansselfpossession mingled at that moment in ostovs soul am not talking about you he said  dont know you and frankly dont want to  am speaking of the staff in generalnd  will tell you this rince ndrew interrupted in a tone of quietauthority you wish to insult me and  am ready to agree with you thatit would be very easy to do so if you havent sufficient selfrespectbut admit that the time and place are very badly chosen n a day or twowe shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel andbesides rubetskoy who says he is an old friend of yours is not atall to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you oweverhe added rising you know my name and where to find me but dontforget that  do not regard either myself or you as having been at allinsulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matterdrop ell then on riday after the review  shall expect yourubetskoy u revoir exclaimed rince ndrew and with a bow to themboth he went outnly when rince ndrew was gone did ostov think of what he ought tohave said nd he was still more angry at having omitted to say it eordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of oris rode homehould he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affectedadjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that worriedhim all the way e thought angrily of the pleasure he would have atseeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered byhis pistol and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knewthere was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that veryadjutant whom he so hated he day after ostov had been to see oris a review was held of theustrian and ussian troops both those freshly arrived from ussia andthose who had been campaigning under utuzov he two mperors theussian with his heir the sarevich and the ustrian with the rchdukeinspected the allied army of eighty thousand menrom early morning the smart clean troops were on the move forming upon the field before the fortress ow thousands of feet and bayonetsmoved and halted at the officers command turned with banners flyingformed up at intervals and wheeled round other similar masses ofinfantry in different uniforms now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofsand the jingling of showy cavalry in blue red and green braideduniforms with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black roanor gray horses then again spreading out with the brazen clatter of thepolished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with thesmell of linstocks came the artillery which crawled between theinfantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position ot only thegenerals in full parade uniforms with their thin or thick waists drawnin to the utmost their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars andwearing scarves and all their decorations not only the elegant pomadedofficers but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face andhis weapons clean and polished to the utmost and every horse groomedtill its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane laysmoothfelt that no small matter was happening but an important andsolemn affair very general and every soldier was conscious of his owninsignificance aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men and yetat the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of thatenormous wholerom early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by tenoclock all had been brought into due order he ranks were drawn up onthe vast field he whole army was extended in three lines the cavalryin front behind it the artillery and behind that again the infantry space like a street was left between each two lines of troops hethree parts of that army were sharply distinguished utuzovs fightingarmy with the avlograds on the right flank of the front thoserecently arrived from ussia both uards and regiments of the line andthe ustrian troops ut they all stood in the same lines under onecommand and in a like orderike wind over leaves ran an excited whisper heyre coming heyrecoming larmed voices were heard and a stir of final preparationswept over all the troopsrom the direction of lmutz in front of them a group was seenapproaching nd at that moment though the day was still a light gustof wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on thelances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs tlooked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing itsjoy at the approach of the mperors ne voice was heard shouting yesfront hen like the crowing of cocks at sunrise this was repeated byothers from various sides and all became silentn the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard his wasthe mperors suites he mperors rode up to the flank and thetrumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march tseemed as though not the trumpeters were playing but as if the armyitself rejoicing at the mperors approach had naturally burst intomusic mid these sounds only the youthful kindly voice of the mperorlexander was clearly heard e gave the words of greeting and thefirst regiment roared urrah so deafeningly continuously andjoyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and theimmensity of the power they constitutedostov standing in the front lines of utuzovs army which the sarapproached first experienced the same feeling as every other man inthat army a feeling of selfforgetfulness a proud consciousness ofmight and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of thistriumphe felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass and hehimself an insignificant atom in it would go through fire and watercommit crime die or perform deeds of highest heroism and so he couldnot but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that wordurrah urrah urrah thundered from all sides one regiment afteranother greeting the sar with the strains of the march and thenurrah hen the general march and again urrah urrah growingever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roarill the sar reached it each regiment in its silence and immobilityseemed like a lifeless body but as soon as he came up it became aliveits thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he hadalready passed hrough the terrible and deafening roar of those voicesamid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned tostone hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly butsymmetrically and above all freely and in front of them two menthemperors pon them the undivided tensely passionate attention of thatwhole mass of men was concentratedhe handsome young mperor lexander in the uniform of the orseuards wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back with hispleasant face and resonant though not loud voice attracted everyonesattentionostov was not far from the trumpeters and with his keen sight hadrecognized the sar and watched his approach hen he was within twentypaces and icholas could clearly distinguish every detail of hishandsome happy young face he experienced a feeling of tenderness andecstasy such as he had never before known very trait and everymovement of the sars seemed to him enchantingtopping in front of the avlograds the sar said something in renchto the ustrian mperor and smiledeeing that smile ostov involuntarily smiled himself and felt a stillstronger flow of love for his sovereign e longed to show that love insome way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry he sarcalled the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to himh od what would happen to me if the mperor spoke to me thoughtostov  should die of happinesshe sar addressed the officers also  thank you all gentlemen thank you with my whole heart o ostov every word sounded like avoice from heaven ow gladly would he have died at once for his sarou have earned the t eorges standards and will be worthy of themh to die to die for him thought ostovhe sar said something more which ostov did not hear and thesoldiers straining their lungs shouted urrahostov too bending over his saddle shouted urrah with all hismight feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout ifonly to express his rapture fullyhe sar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecidedow can the mperor be undecided thought ostov but then even thisindecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting like everything elsethe sar didhat hesitation lasted only an instant he sars foot in the narrowpointed boot then fashionable touched the groin of the bobtailed baymare he rode his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins and hemoved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aidesdecamparther and farther he rode away stopping at other regiments till atlast only his white plumes were visible to ostov from amid the suitesthat surrounded the mperorsmong the gentlemen of the suite ostov noticed olkonski sitting hishorse indolently and carelessly ostov recalled their quarrel ofyesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or oughtnot to challenge olkonski f course not he now thought s itworth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment t a time of suchlove such rapture and such selfsacrifice what do any of our quarrelsand affronts matter  love and forgive everybody nowhen the mperor had passed nearly all the regiments the troops began aceremonial march past him and ostov on edouin recently purchasedfrom enisov rode past too at the rear of his squadronthat is aloneand in full view of the mperorefore he reached him ostov who was a splendid horseman spurrededouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which theanimal went when excited ending his foaming muzzle to his chest histail extended edouin as if also conscious of the mperors eye uponhim passed splendidly lifting his feet with a high and gracefulaction as if flying through the air without touching the groundostov himself his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feelinghimself one with his horse rode past the mperor with a frowning butblissful face like a vewy devil as enisov expressed itine fellows the avlograds remarked the mperory od how happy  should be if he ordered me to leap into the firethis instant thought ostovhen the review was over the newly arrived officers and alsoutuzovs collected in groups and began to talk about the awards aboutthe ustrians and their uniforms about their lines about onaparteand how badly the latter would fare now especially if the ssen corpsarrived and russia took our sideut the talk in every group was chiefly about the mperor lexander isevery word and movement was described with ecstasyhey all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against theenemy under the mperors command ommanded by the mperor himself theycould not fail to vanquish anyone be it whom it might so thoughtostov and most of the officers after the reviewll were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battleswould have made them he day after the review oris in his best uniform and with hiscomrade ergs best wishes for success rode to lmutz to see olkonskiwishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the bestpost he couldpreferably that of adjutant to some important personagea position in the army which seemed to him most attractive t is allvery well for ostov whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at atime to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyoneslackey but  who have nothing but my brains have to make a career andmust not miss opportunities but must avail myself of them hereflectede did not find rince ndrew in lmutz that day but the appearance ofthe town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationedand the two mperors were living with their suites households andcourts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher worlde knew no one and despite his smart uardsmans uniform all theseexalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriageswith their plumes ribbons and medals both courtiers and military menseemed so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of theuards that they not only did not wish to but simply could not beaware of his existence t the quarters of the commanderinchiefutuzov where he inquired for olkonski all the adjutants and even theorderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a greatmany officers like him were always coming there and that everybody washeartily sick of them n spite of this or rather because of it nextday ovember  after dinner he again went to lmutz and entering thehouse occupied by utuzov asked for olkonski rince ndrew was in andoris was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancingbut in which five beds now stood and furniture of various kinds atable chairs and a clavichord ne adjutant nearest the door wassitting at the table in a ersian dressing gown writing nother thered stout esvitski lay on a bed with his arms under his headlaughing with an officer who had sat down beside him  third wasplaying a iennese waltz on the clavichord while a fourth lying on theclavichord sang the tune olkonski was not there one of thesegentlemen changed his position on seeing oris he one who was writingand whom oris addressed turned round crossly and told him olkonski wason duty and that he should go through the door on the left into thereception room if he wished to see him oris thanked him and went tothe reception room where he found some ten officers and generalshen he entered rince ndrew his eyes drooping contemptuously withthat peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says f itwere not my duty  would not talk to you for a moment was listeningto an old ussian general with decorations who stood very erect almoston tiptoe with a soldiers obsequious expression on his purple facereporting somethingery well then be so good as to wait said rince ndrew to thegeneral in ussian speaking with the rench intonation he affectedwhen he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing oris rincendrew paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploringhim to hear something more nodded and turned to him with a cheerfulsmilet that moment oris clearly realized what he had before surmised thatin the army besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in themilitary code which he and the others knew in the regiment there wasanother more important subordination which made this tightlacedpurplefaced general wait respectfully while aptain rince ndrew forhis own pleasure chose to chat with ieutenant rubetskoy ore thanever was oris resolved to serve in future not according to the writtencode but under this unwritten law e felt now that merely by havingbeen recommended to rince ndrew he had already risen above the generalwho at the front had the power to annihilate him a lieutenant of theuards rince ndrew came up to him and took his hand am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday  was fussing aboutwith ermans all day e went with eyrother to survey the dispositionshen ermans start being accurate theres no end to itoris smiled as if he understood what rince ndrew was alluding to assomething generally known ut it was the first time he had heardeyrothers name or even the term dispositionsell my dear fellow so you still want to be an adjutant  have beenthinking about youes  was thinkingfor some reason oris could not help blushingof asking the commanderinchief e has had a letter from rinceuragin about me  only wanted to ask because  fear the uards wontbe in action he added as if in apologyll right all right ell talk it over replied rince ndrew nlylet me report this gentlemans business and  shall be at yourdisposalhile rince ndrew went to report about the purplefaced general thatgentlemanevidently not sharing oris conception of the advantages ofthe unwritten code of subordinationlooked so fixedly at thepresumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had tosay to the adjutant that oris felt uncomfortable e turned away andwaited impatiently for rince ndrews return from the commanderinchiefs roomou see my dear fellow  have been thinking about you said rincendrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord wasts no use your going to the commanderinchief e would say a lot ofpleasant things ask you to dinner hat would not be bad as regardsthe unwritten code thought oris but nothing more would come of ithere will soon be a battalion of us aidesdecamp and adjutants utthis is what well do  have a good friend an adjutant general and anexcellent fellow rince olgorukov and though you may not know it thefact is that now utuzov with his staff and all of us count for nothingverything is now centered round the mperor o we will go toolgorukov  have to go there anyhow and  have already spoken to himabout you e shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or finda place for you somewhere nearer the sunrince ndrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a youngman and help him to worldly success nder cover of obtaining help ofthis kind for another which from pride he would never accept forhimself he kept in touch with the circle which confers success andwhich attracted him e very readily took up oris cause and went withhim to olgorukovt was late in the evening when they entered the palace at lmutzoccupied by the mperors and their retinueshat same day a council of war had been held in which all the members ofthe ofkriegsrath and both mperors took part t that council contraryto the views of the old generals utuzov and rince chwartzenberg ithad been decided to advance immediately and give battle to onapartehe council of war was just over when rince ndrew accompanied by orisarrived at the palace to find olgorukov veryone at headquarters wasstill under the spell of the days council at which the party of theyoung had triumphed he voices of those who counseled delay and advisedwaiting for something else before advancing had been so completelysilenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of theadvantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the councilthecoming battle and the victory that would certainly result from itnolonger seemed to be in the future but in the past ll the advantageswere on our side ur enormous forces undoubtedly superior toapoleons were concentrated in one place the troops inspired by themperors presence were eager for action he strategic position wherethe operations would take place was familiar in all its details to theustrian eneral eyrother a lucky accident had ordained that theustrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields wherethe rench had now to be fought the adjacent locality was known andshown in every detail on the maps and onaparte evidently weakenedwas undertaking nothingolgorukov one of the warmest advocates of an attack had just returnedfrom the council tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victorythat had been gained rince ndrew introduced his protege but rinceolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to orisand evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost inhis mind at that moment addressed rince ndrew in renchh my dear fellow what a battle we have gained od grant that theone that will result from it will be as victorious owever dearfellow he said abruptly and eagerly  must confess to having beenunjust to the ustrians and especially to eyrother hat exactitudewhat minuteness what knowledge of the locality what foresight forevery eventuality every possibility even to the smallest detail o mydear fellow no conditions better than our present ones could have beendevised his combination of ustrian precision with ussian valorwhatmore could be wished foro the attack is definitely resolved on asked olkonskind do you know my dear fellow it seems to me that onaparte hasdecidedly lost bearings you know that a letter was received from himtoday for the mperor olgorukov smiled significantlys that so nd what did he say inquired olkonskihat can he say radiridira and so on merely to gain time tell you he is in our hands thats certain ut what was most amusinghe continued with a sudden goodnatured laugh was that we could notthink how to address the reply f not as onsul and of course not asmperor it seemed to me it should be to eneral onaparteut between not recognizing him as mperor and calling him eneralonaparte there is a difference remarked olkonskihats just it interrupted olgorukov quickly laughing ou knowilibinhes a very clever fellow e suggested addressing him assurper and nemy of ankindolgorukov laughed merrilynly that said olkonskill the same it was ilibin who found a suitable form for the addresse is a wise and clever fellowhat was ito the ead of the rench overnment u chef du gouvernementfrancais said olgorukov with grave satisfaction ood wasnt ites but he will dislike it extremely said olkonskih yes very much y brother knows him hes dined with himthepresent mperormore than once in aris and tells me he never met amore cunning or subtle diplomatistyou know a combination of renchadroitness and talian playacting o you know the tale about him andount arkov ount arkov was the only man who knew how to handle himou know the story of the handkerchief t is delightfulnd the talkative olgorukov turning now to oris now to rincendrew told how onaparte wishing to test arkov our ambassadorpurposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking atarkov probably expecting arkov to pick it up for him and how arkovimmediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touchingonaparteselightful said olkonski ut  have come to you rince as apetitioner on behalf of this young man ou see but before rincendrew could finish an aidedecamp came in to summon olgorukov to themperorh what a nuisance said olgorukov getting up hurriedly andpressing the hands of rince ndrew and oris ou know  should bevery glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear youngman gain he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression ofgoodnatured sincere and animated levity ut you see anothertimeoris was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powersas he felt himself to be at that moment e was conscious that here hewas in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormousmovements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tinyobedient and insignificant atom hey followed rince olgorukov outinto the corridor and metcoming out of the door of the mperors roomby which olgorukov had entereda short man in civilian clothes with aclever face and sharply projecting jaw which without spoiling his facegave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression his shortman nodded to olgorukov as to an intimate friend and stared at rincendrew with cool intensity walking straight toward him and evidentlyexpecting him to bow or to step out of his way rince ndrew didneither a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turnedaway and went down the side of the corridorho was that asked orise is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant of mentheinister of oreign ffairs rince dam zartoryski t is such menas he who decide the fate of nations added olkonski with a sigh hecould not suppress as they passed out of the palaceext day the army began its campaign and up to the very battle ofusterlitz oris was unable to see either rince ndrew or olgorukovagain and remained for a while with the smaylov regiment t dawn on the sixteenth of ovember enisovs squadron in whichicholas ostov served and which was in rince agrations detachmentmoved from the place where it had spent the night advancing into actionas arranged and after going behind other columns for about two thirdsof a mile was stopped on the highroad ostov saw the ossacks and thenthe first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions andartillery pass by and go forward and then enerals agration andolgorukov ride past with their adjutants ll the fear before actionwhich he had experienced as previously all the inner struggle toconquer that fear all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a truehussar in this battle had been wasted heir squadron remained inreserve and icholas ostov spent that day in a dull and wretched moodt nine in the morning he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrahand saw wounded being brought back there were not many of them and atlast he saw how a whole detachment of rench cavalry was brought inconvoyed by a sotnya of ossacks vidently the affair was over andthough not big had been a successful engagement he men and officersreturning spoke of a brilliant victory of the occupation of the town ofischau and the capture of a whole rench squadron he day was brightand sunny after a sharp night frost and the cheerful glitter of thatautumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyednot only by the tales of those who had taken part in it but also by thejoyful expression on the faces of soldiers officers generals andadjutants as they passed ostov going or coming nd icholas who hadvainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent thathappy day in inactivity was all the more depressedome here ostov ets dwink to dwown our gwief shouted enisovwho had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some foodhe officers gathered round enisovs canteen eating and talkinghere hey are bringing another cried one of the officersindicating a captive rench dragoon who was being brought in on foot bytwo ossacksne of them was leading by the bridle a fine large rench horse he hadtaken from the prisonerell us that horse enisov called out to the ossacksf you like your honorhe officers got up and stood round the ossacks and their prisoner herench dragoon was a young lsatian who spoke rench with a ermanaccent e was breathless with agitation his face was red and when heheard some rench spoken he at once began speaking to the officersaddressing first one then another e said he would not have beentaken it was not his fault but the corporals who had sent him to seizesome horsecloths though he had told him the ussians were there nd atevery word he added ut dont hurt my little horse and stroked theanimal t was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was ow heexcused himself for having been taken prisoner and now imagininghimself before his own officers insisted on his soldierly disciplineand zeal in the service e brought with him into our rearguard all thefreshness of atmosphere of the rench army which was so alien to ushe ossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces and ostov being therichest of the officers now that he had received his money bought itut dont hurt my little horse said the lsatian goodnaturedly toostov when the animal was handed over to the hussarostov smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him moneylley lley said the ossack touching the prisoners arm to makehim go onhe mperor he mperor was suddenly heard among the hussarsll began to run and bustle and ostov saw coming up the road behindhim several riders with white plumes in their hats n a moment everyonewas in his place waitingostov did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mountednstantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected moodamid people of whom he was weary had gone instantly every thought ofhimself had vanished e was filled with happiness at his nearness tothe mperor e felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for theday he had lost e was happy as a lover when the longedfor moment ofmeeting arrives ot daring to look round and without looking round hewas ecstatically conscious of his approach e felt it not only from thesound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade but because as he drewnear everything grew brighter more joyful more significant and morefestive around him earer and nearer to ostov came that sun sheddingbeams of mild and majestic light around and already he felt himselfenveloped in those beams he heard his voice that kindly calm andmajestic voice that was yet so simple nd as if in accord with ostovsfeeling there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard themperors voicehe avlograd hussars he inquiredhe reserves sire replied a voice a very human one compared to thatwhich had said he avlograd hussarshe mperor drew level with ostov and halted lexanders face was evenmore beautiful than it had been three days before at the review tshone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth that it suggestedthe liveliness of a fourteenyearold boy and yet it was the face ofthe majestic mperor asually while surveying the squadron themperors eyes met ostovs and rested on them for not more than twoseconds hether or no the mperor understood what was going on inostovs soul it seemed to ostov that he understood everything atany rate his lightblue eyes gazed for about two seconds into ostovsface  gentle mild light poured from them hen all at once he raisedhis eyebrows abruptly touched his horse with his left foot andgalloped onhe younger mperor could not restrain his wish to be present at thebattle and in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers at twelveoclock left the third column with which he had been and galloped towardthe vanguard efore he came up with the hussars several adjutants methim with news of the successful result of the actionhis battle which consisted in the capture of a rench squadron wasrepresented as a brilliant victory over the rench and so the mperorand the whole army especially while the smoke hung over thebattlefield believed that the rench had been defeated and wereretreating against their will  few minutes after the mperor hadpassed the avlograd division was ordered to advance n ischauitself a petty erman town ostov saw the mperor again n the marketplace where there had been some rather heavy firing before themperors arrival lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom therehad not been time to move he mperor surrounded by his suite ofofficers and courtiers was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare adifferent one from that which he had ridden at the review and bendingto one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and lookedat a soldier who lay prone with blood on his uncovered head hewounded soldier was so dirty coarse and revolting that his proximityto the mperor shocked ostov ostov saw how the mperors rather roundshoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them how his leftfoot began convulsively tapping the horses side with the spur and howthe welltrained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir nadjutant dismounting lifted the soldier under the arms to place him ona stretcher that had been brought he soldier groanedently gently ant you do it more gently said the mperorapparently suffering more than the dying soldier and he rode awayostov saw tears filling the mperors eyes and heard him as he wasriding away say to zartoryski hat a terrible thing war is what aterrible thing uelle terrible chose que la guerrehe troops of the vanguard were stationed before ischau within sightof the enemys lines which all day long had yielded ground to us at theleast firing he mperors gratitude was announced to the vanguardrewards were promised and the

went wandering among the campfires dreaming ofwhat happiness it would be to dienot in saving the mperors life hedid not even dare to dream of that but simply to die before his eyese really was in love with the sar and the glory of the ussian armsand the hope of future triumph nd he was not the only man toexperience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battleof usterlitz nine tenths of the men in the ussian army were then inlove though less ecstatically with their sar and the glory of theussian arms he next day the mperor stopped at ischau and illier his physicianwas repeatedly summoned to see him t headquarters and among the troopsnear by the news spread that the mperor was unwell e ate nothing andhad slept badly that night those around him reported he cause of thisindisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind bythe sight of the killed and woundedt daybreak on the seventeenth a rench officer who had come with aflag of truce demanding an audience with the ussian mperor wasbrought into ischau from our outposts his officer was avary hemperor had only just fallen asleep and so avary had to wait t middayhe was admitted to the mperor and an hour later he rode off withrince olgorukov to the advanced post of the rench armyt was rumored that avary had been sent to propose to lexander ameeting with apoleon o the joy and pride of the whole army apersonal interview was refused and instead of the overeign rinceolgorukov the victor at ischau was sent with avary to negotiatewith apoleon if contrary to expectations these negotiations wereactuated by a real desire for peaceoward evening olgorukov came back went straight to the sar andremained alone with him for a long timen the eighteenth and nineteenth of ovember the army advanced twodays march and the enemys outposts after a brief interchange of shotsretreated n the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth agreat excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morningof the twentieth when the memorable battle of usterlitz was foughtill midday on the nineteenth the activitythe eager talk running toand fro and dispatching of adjutantswas confined to the mperorsheadquarters ut on the afternoon of that day this activity reachedutuzovs headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns yevening the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the armyand in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth the whole eightythousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voicesand the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles longhe concentrated activity which had begun at the mperors headquartersin the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was likethe first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock ne wheelslowly moved another was set in motion and a third and wheels beganto revolve faster and faster levers and cogwheels to work chimes toplay figures to pop out and the hands to advance with regular motionas a result of all that activityust as in the mechanism of a clock so in the mechanism of the militarymachine an impulse once given leads to the final result and just asindifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted tothem are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yetreached heels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another andthe revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement but aneighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were preparedto remain so for a hundred years but the moment comes when the levercatches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joinsin the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its kenust as in a clock the result of the complicated motion of innumerablewheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the handswhich show the time so the result of all the complicated humanactivities of  ussians and renchall their passions desiresremorse humiliations sufferings outbursts of pride fear andenthusiasmwas only the loss of the battle of usterlitz the socalledbattle of the three mperorsthat is to say a slow movement of thehand on the dial of human historyrince ndrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on thecommanderinchieft six in the evening utuzov went to the mperors headquarters andafter staying but a short time with the sar went to see the grandmarshal of the court ount olstoyolkonski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of thecoming action from olgorukov e felt that utuzov was upset anddissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they weredissatisfied with him and also that at the mperors headquarterseveryone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others donot know he therefore wished to speak to olgorukovell how dyou do my dear fellow said olgorukov who was sittingat tea with ilibin he fete is for tomorrow ow is your old fellowut of sorts wont say he is out of sorts but  fancy he would like to be heardut they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when hetalks sense but to temporize and wait for something now when onapartefears nothing so much as a general battle is impossiblees you have seen him said rince ndrew ell what is onapartelike ow did he impress youes  saw him and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as ageneral engagement repeated olgorukov evidently prizing this generalconclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with apoleon fhe werent afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview hynegotiate and above all why retreat when to retreat is so contrary tohis method of conducting war elieve me he is afraid afraid of ageneral battle is hour has come ark my wordsut tell me what is he like eh said rince ndrew againe is a man in a gray overcoat very anxious that  should call himour ajesty but who to his chagrin got no title from me hatsthe sort of man he is and nothing more replied olgorukov lookinground at ilibin with a smileespite my great respect for old utuzov he continued we should bea nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chanceto escape or to trick us now that we certainly have him in our handso we mustnt forget uvorov and his rulenot to put yourself in aposition to be attacked but yourself to attack elieve me in war theenergy of young men often shows the way better than all the experienceof old unctatorsut in what position are we going to attack him  have been at theoutposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces aresituated said rince ndrewe wished to explain to olgorukov a plan of attack he had himselfformedh that is all the same olgorukov said quickly and getting up hespread a map on the table ll eventualities have been foreseen f heis standing before runnnd rince olgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained eyrothersplan of a flanking movementrince ndrew began to reply and to state his own plan which might havebeen as good as eyrothers but for the disadvantage that eyrothershad already been approved s soon as rince ndrew began to demonstratethe defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan rinceolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed absentmindedly not at themap but at rince ndrews facehere will be a council of war at utuzovs tonight though you cansay all this there remarked olgorukov will do so said rince ndrew moving away from the maphatever are you bothering about gentlemen said ilibin who tillthen had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and nowwas evidently ready with a joke hether tomorrow brings victory ordefeat the glory of our ussian arms is secure xcept your utuzovthere is not a single ussian in command of a column he commandersare

gentlemen he added and went out aftershaking hands with olgorukov and ilibinn the way home rince ndrew could not refrain from asking utuzovwho was sitting silently beside him what he thought of tomorrowsbattleutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and after a pause replied think the battle will be lost and so  told ount olstoy and asked himto tell the mperor hat do you think he replied ut my deargeneral  am engaged with rice and cutlets look after military mattersyourself es hat was the answer  got hortly after nine oclock that evening eyrother drove with his plansto utuzovs quarters where the council of war was to be held ll thecommanders of columns were summoned to the commanderinchiefs and withthe exception of rince agration who declined to come were all thereat the appointed timeeyrother who was in full control of the proposed battle by hiseagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfiedand drowsy utuzov who reluctantly played the part of chairman andpresident of the council of war eyrother evidently felt himself to beat the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable e waslike a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart hether he waspulling it or being pushed by it he did not know but rushed along atheadlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might leadto eyrother had been twice that evening to the enemys picket line toreconnoiter personally and twice to the mperors ussian and ustrianto report and explain and to his headquarters where he had dictated thedispositions in erman and now much exhausted he arrived atutuzovse was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to thecommander in chief e interrupted him talked rapidly and indistinctlywithout looking at the man he was addressing and did not reply toquestions put to him e was bespattered with mud and had a pitifulweary and distracted air though at the same time he was haughty andselfconfidentutuzov was occupying a noblemans castle of modest dimensions nearstralitz n the large drawing room which had become the commander inchiefs office were gathered utuzov himself eyrother and the membersof the council of war hey were drinking tea and only awaited rinceagration to begin the council t last agrations orderly came withthe news that the prince could not attend rince ndrew came in toinform the commanderinchief of this and availing himself ofpermission previously given him by utuzov to be present at the councilhe remained in the roomince rince agration is not coming we may begin said eyrotherhurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which anenormous map of the environs of runn was spread oututuzov with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged overhis collar as if escaping was sitting almost asleep in a low chairwith his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms t the soundof eyrothers voice he opened his one eye with an effortes yes if you please t is already late said he and nodding hishead he let it droop and again closed his eyef at first the members of the council thought that utuzov waspretending to sleep the sounds his nose emitted during the reading thatfollowed proved that the commanderinchief at that moment was absorbedby a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for thedispositions or anything elsehe was engaged in satisfying theirresistible human need for sleep e really was asleep eyrother withthe gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment glanced at utuzov andhaving convinced himself that he was asleep took up a paper and in aloud monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for theimpending battle under a heading which he also read outispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind obelnitz andokolnitz ovember  he dispositions were very complicated and difficult hey began asfollowss the enemys left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extendsalong obelnitz and okolnitz behind the ponds that are there while weon the other hand with our left wing by far outflank his right it isadvantageous to attack the enemys latter wing especially if we occupythe villages of okolnitz and obelnitz whereby we can both fall on hisflank and pursue him over the plain between chlappanitz and thehuerassa forest avoiding the defiles of chlappanitz and ellowitzwhich cover the enemys front or this object it is necessary thathe first column marches he second column marches he thirdcolumn marches and so on read eyrotherhe generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositionshe

his glistening wideopen eyes fixed upon him and his mustachetwisted upwards sat the ruddy iloradovich in a military pose hiselbows turned outwards his hands on his knees and his shouldersraised e remained stubbornly silent gazing at eyrothers face andonly turned away his eyes when the ustrian chief of staff finishedreading hen iloradovich looked round significantly at the othergenerals ut one could not tell from that significant look whether heagreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements extto eyrother sat ount angeron who with a subtle smile that never lefthis typically southern rench face during the whole time of the readinggazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners agold snuffbox on which was a portrait n the middle of one of thelongest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raisedhis head and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of histhin lips interrupted eyrother wishing to say something ut theustrian general continuing to read frowned angrily and jerked hiselbows as if to say ou can tell me your views later but now be sogood as to look at the map and listen angeron lifted his eyes with anexpression of perplexity turned round to iloradovich as if seeking anexplanation but meeting the latters impressive but meaningless gazedrooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox

inattention ohkturov a little man sat opposite eyrother with anassiduous and modest mien and stooping over the outspread mapconscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality easked eyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heardand the difficult names of villages eyrother complied and ohkturovnoted them downhen the reading which lasted more than an hour was over angeron againbrought his snuffbox to rest and without looking at eyrother or atanyone in particular began to say how difficult it was to carry outsuch a plan in which the enemys position was assumed to be knownwhereas it was perhaps not known since the enemy was in movementangerons objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aimwas to show eneral eyrotherwho had read his dispositions with asmuch selfconfidence as if he were addressing school childrenthat hehad to do not with fools but with men who could teach him something inmilitary mattershen the monotonous sound of eyrothers voice ceased utuzov openedhis eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheelis interrupted e listened to what angeron said as if remarking oyou are still at that silly business quickly closed his eye again andlet his head sink still lowerangeron trying as virulently as possible to sting eyrothers vanityas author of the military plan argued that onaparte might easilyattack instead of being attacked and so render the whole of this planperfectly worthless eyrother met all objections with a firm andcontemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objectionsbe they what they mightf he could attack us he would have done so today said heo you think he is powerless said angerone has forty thousand men at most replied eyrother with the smileof a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of acasen that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack saidangeron with a subtly ironical smile again glancing round for supportto iloradovich who was near himut iloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anythingrather than of what the generals were disputing abouta foi said he tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefieldeyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it wasstrange and ridiculous to meet objections from ussian generals and tohave to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of buthad also convinced the sovereign mperors ofhe enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard fromhis camp said he hat does that mean ither he is retreating whichis the only thing we need fear or he is changing his position esmiled ironically ut even if he also took up a position in thehuerassa he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all ourarrangements to the minutest detail remain the sameow is that began rince ndrew who had for long been waiting anopportunity to express his doubtsutuzov here woke up coughed heavily and looked round at the generalsentlemen the dispositions for tomorrowor rather for today for itis past midnightcannot now be altered said he ou have heard themand we shall all do our duty ut before a battle there is nothing moreimportant he paused than to have a good sleepe moved as if to rise he generals bowed and retired t was pastmidnight rince ndrew went outhe council of war at which rince ndrew had not been able to expresshis opinion as he had hoped to left on him a vague and uneasyimpression hether olgorukov and eyrother or utuzov angeron andthe others who did not approve of the plan of attack were righthe didnot know ut was it really not possible for utuzov to state his viewsplainly to the mperor s it possible that on account of court andpersonal considerations tens of thousands of lives and my life mylife he thought must be riskedes it is very likely that  shall be killed tomorrow he thoughtnd suddenly at this thought of death a whole series of most distantmost intimate memories rose in his imagination he remembered his lastparting from his father and his wife he remembered the days when hefirst loved her e thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her andfor himself and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went outof the hut in which he was billeted with esvitski and began to walk upand down before ithe night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamedmysteriously es tomorrow tomorrow he thought omorroweverything may be over for me ll these memories will be no more noneof them will have any meaning for me omorrow perhaps even certainly have a presentiment that for the first time  shall have to show all can do nd his fancy pictured the battle its loss the concentrationof fighting at one point and the hesitation of all the commanders ndthen that happy moment that oulon for which he had so long waitedpresents itself to him at last e firmly and clearly expresses hisopinion to utuzov to eyrother and to the mperors ll are struck bythe justness of his views but no one undertakes to carry them out sohe takes a regiment a divisionstipulates that no one is to interferewith his arrangementsleads his division to the decisive point andgains the victory alone ut death and suffering suggested anothervoice rince ndrew however did not answer that voice and went ondreaming of his triumphs he dispositions for the next battle areplanned by him alone ominally he is only an adjutant on utuzovsstaff but he does everything alone he next battle is won by himalone utuzov is removed and he is appointed ell and then askedthe other voice f before that you are not ten times wounded killedor betrayed well what then ell then rince ndrew answeredhimself  dont know what will happen and dont want to know andcant but if  want thiswant glory want to be known to men want tobe loved by them it is not my fault that  want it and want nothing butthat and live only for that es for that alone  shall never tellanyone but oh od what am  to do if  love nothing but fame andmens esteem eath wounds the loss of family fear nothing ndprecious and dear as many persons are to mefather sister wifethosedearest to meyet dreadful and unnatural as it seems  would give themall at once for a moment of glory of triumph over men of love from men dont know and never shall know for the love of these men here hethought as he listened to voices in utuzovs courtyard he voiceswere those of the orderlies who were packing up one voice probably acoachmans was teasing utuzovs old cook whom rince ndrew knew andwho was called it e was saying it  say itell returned the old mano it thresh a bit said the wagh go to the devil called out a voice drowned by the laughter ofthe orderlies and servantsll the same  love and value nothing but triumph over them all value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in thismist hat same night ostov was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in frontof agrations detachment is hussars were placed along the line incouples and he himself rode along the line trying to master thesleepiness that kept coming over him n enormous space with our armyscampfires dimly glowing in the fog could be seen behind him in frontof him was misty darkness ostov could see nothing peer as he wouldinto that foggy distance now something gleamed gray now there wassomething black now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemyought to be now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes iseyes kept closing and in his fancy appearednow the mperor nowenisov and now oscow memoriesand he again hurriedly opened his eyesand saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was ridingand sometimes when he came within six paces of them the black figuresof hussars but in the distance was still the same misty darkness hynot t might easily happen thought ostov that the mperor willmeet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer hellsay o and find out whats there here are many stories of hisgetting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching himto himself hat if he gave me a place near him h how  would guardhim how  would tell him the truth how  would unmask his deceiversnd in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereignostov pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful erman whom he wouldnot only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face beforethe mperor uddenly a distant shout aroused him e started and openedhis eyeshere am  h yes in the skirmishing line pass and watchwordshaft lmutz hat a nuisance that our squadron will be in reservetomorrow he thought ll ask leave to go to the front this may bemy only chance of seeing the mperor t wont be long now before  amoff duty ll take another turn and when  get back ll go to thegeneral and ask him e readjusted himself in the saddle and touched uphis horse to ride once more round his hussars t seemed to him that itwas getting lighter o the left he saw a sloping descent lit up andfacing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall n this knollthere was a white patch that ostov could not at all make out was it aglade in the wood lit up by the moon or some unmelted snow or somewhite houses e even thought something moved on that white spot expect its snow that spot a spotune tache he thought herenow its not a tache atasha sister black eyes atasha ont she be surprised when  tell her how ve seen themperor atasha take my sabretacheeep to the right yourhonor there are bushes here came the voice of an hussar past whomostov was riding in the act of falling asleep ostov lifted his headthat had sunk almost to his horses mane and pulled up beside thehussar e was succumbing to irresistible youthful childishdrowsiness ut what was  thinking  mustnt forget ow shall speak to the mperor o thats not itthats tomorrow h

ut themdown hat said ostov waking up t the moment he opened his eyeshe heard in front of him where the enemy was the longdrawn shouts ofthousands of voices is horse and the horse of the hussar near himpricked their ears at these shouts ver there where the shouting camefrom a fire flared up and went out again then another and all alongthe rench line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louderand louder ostov could hear the sound of rench words but could notdistinguish them he din of many voices was too great all he couldhear was ahahah and rrrrhats that hat do you make of it said ostov to the hussar besidehim hat must be the enemys camphe hussar did not replyhy dont you hear it ostov asked again after waiting for a replyho can tell your honor replied the hussar reluctantlyrom the direction it must be the enemy repeated ostovt may be he or it may be nothing muttered the hussar ts darkteady he cried to his fidgeting horseostovs horse was also getting restive it pawed the frozen groundpricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights he shoutinggrew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army ofseveral thousand men could produce he lights spread farther andfarther probably along the line of the rench camp ostov no longerwanted to sleep he gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had astimulating effect on him ive lmpereur mpereur he now hearddistinctlyhey cant be far off probably just beyond the stream he said to thehussar beside himhe hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily he soundof horses hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars washeard and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussarssuddenly appeared looming huge as an elephantour honor the generals said the sergeant riding up to ostovostov still looking round toward the fires and the shouts rode withthe sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the linene was on a white horse rince agration and rince olgorukov withtheir adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lightsand shouts in the enemys camp ostov rode up to agration reported tohim and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals weresayingelieve me said rince olgorukov addressing agration it isnothing but a trick e has retreated and ordered the rearguard tokindle fires and make a noise to deceive usardly said agration  saw them this evening on that knoll ifthey had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too fficersaid agration to ostov are the enemys skirmishers still therehey were there this evening but now  dont know your excellencyhall  go with some of my hussars to see replied ostovagration stopped and before replying tried to see ostovs face inthe mistell go and see he said after a pausees sirostov spurred his horse called to ergeant edchenko and two otherhussars told them to follow him and trotted downhill in the directionfrom which the shouting came e felt both frightened and pleased to beriding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous mistydistance where no one had been before him agration called to him fromthe hill not to go beyond the stream but ostov pretended not to hearhim and did not stop but rode on and on continually mistaking bushesfor trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakesaving descended the hill at a trot he no longer saw either our own orthe enemys fires but heard the shouting of the rench more loudly anddistinctly n the valley he saw before him something like a river butwhen he reached it he found it was a road aving come out onto the roadhe reined in his horse hesitating whether to ride along it or cross itand ride over the black field up the hillside o keep to the road whichgleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would beeasier to see people coming along it ollow me said he crossed theroad and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point wherethe rench pickets had been standing that eveningour honor there he is cried one of the hussars behind him ndbefore ostov had time to make out what the black thing was that hadsuddenly appeared in the fog there was a flash followed by a reportand a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passedout of hearing nother musket missed fire but flashed in the panostov turned his horse and galloped back our more reports followed atintervals and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing indifferent tones ostov reined in his horse whose spirits had risenlike his own at the firing and went back at a footpace ell somemore ome more a merry voice was saying in his soul ut no moreshots camenly when approaching agration did ostov let his horse gallop againand with his hand at the salute rode up to the generalolgorukov was still insisting that the rench had retreated and hadonly lit fires to deceive ushat does that prove he was saying as ostov rode up hey mightretreat and leave the picketsts plain that they have not all gone yet rince said agrationait till tomorrow morning well find out everything tomorrowhe picket is still on the hill your excellency just where it was inthe evening reported ostov stooping forward with his hand at thesalute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his rideand especially by the sound of the bulletsery good very good said agration hank you officerour excellency said ostov may  ask a favorhat is itomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve ay  ask to be attached tothe first squadronhats your nameount ostovh very well you may stay in attendance on meount lya ostovs son asked olgorukovut ostov did not replyhen  may reckon on it your excellency will give the orderomorrow very likely  may be sent with some message to the mperorthought ostovhank odhe fires and shouting in the enemys army were occasioned by the factthat while apoleons proclamation was being read to the troops themperor himself rode round his bivouacs he soldiers on seeing himlit wisps of straw and ran after him shouting ive lmpereurapoleons proclamation was as followsoldiers he ussian army is advancing against you to avenge theustrian army of lm hey are the same battalions you broke atollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place he position weoccupy is a strong one and while they are marching to go round me onthe right they will expose a flank to me oldiers  will myself directyour battalions  will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valorcarry disorder and confusion into the enemys ranks but should victorybe in doubt even for a moment you will see your mperor exposinghimself to the first blows of the enemy for there must be no doubt ofvictory especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor ofthe rench infantry so necessary to the honor of our nationo not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded et everyman be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelingsof ngland inspired by such hatred of our nation his victory willconclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters where freshrench troops who are being raised in rance will join us and the peace shall conclude will be worthy of my people of you and of myself t five in the morning it was still quite dark he troops of thecenter the reserves and agrations right flank had not yet moved buton the left flank the columns of infantry cavalry and artillery whichwere to be the first to descend the heights to attack the rench rightflank and drive it into the ohemian mountains according to plan werealready up and astir he smoke of the campfires into which they werethrowing everything superfluous made the eyes smart t was cold anddark he officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting thesoldiers munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warmthemselves gathering round the fires throwing into the flames theremains of sheds chairs tables wheels tubs and everything that theydid not want or could not carry away with them ustrian column guideswere moving in and out among the ussian troops and served as heralds ofthe advance s soon as an ustrian officer showed himself near acommanding officers quarters the regiment began to move the soldiersran from the fires thrust their pipes into their boots their bags intothe carts got their muskets ready and formed rank he officersbuttoned up their coats buckled on their swords and pouches and movedalong the ranks shouting he train drivers and orderlies harnessed andpacked the wagons and tied on the loads he adjutants and battalion andregimental commanders mounted crossed themselves gave finalinstructions orders and commissions to the baggage men who remainedbehind and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded hecolumn moved forward without knowing where and unable from the massesaround them the smoke and the increasing fog to see either the placethey were leaving or that to which they were going soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment asmuch as a sailor is by his ship owever far he has walked whateverstrange unknown and dangerous places he reaches just as a sailor isalways surrounded by the same decks masts and rigging of his ship sothe soldier always has around him the same comrades the same ranks thesame sergeant major van itrich the same company dog ack and thesame commanders he sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in whichhis ship is sailing but on the day of battleheaven knows how andwhencea stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moralatmosphere of an army announcing the approach of something decisive andsolemn and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity n the day ofbattle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of theirregiment they listen intently look about and eagerly ask concerningwhat is going on around themhe fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they couldnot see ten paces ahead ushes looked like gigantic trees and levelground like cliffs and slopes nywhere on any side one mightencounter an enemy invisible ten paces off ut the columns advanced fora long time always in the same fog descending and ascending hillsavoiding gardens and enclosures going over new and unknown ground andnowhere encountering the enemy n the contrary the soldiers becameaware that in front behind and on all sides other ussian columnswere moving in the same direction very soldier felt glad to know thatto the unknown place where he was going many more of our men were goingtoohere now the urskies have also gone past was being said in theranksts wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered lads ast night looked at the campfires and there was no end of them  regularoscowhough none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked tothe men the commanders as we saw at the council of war were out ofhumor and dissatisfied with the affair and so did not exert themselvesto cheer the men but merely carried out the orders yet the troopsmarched gaily as they always do when going into action especially toan attack ut when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fogthe greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousnessof some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks ow such aconsciousness is communicated is very difficult to define but itcertainly is communicated very surely and flows rapidly imperceptiblyand irrepressibly as water does in a creek ad the ussian army beenalone without any allies it might perhaps have been a long time beforethis consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction but asit was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupidermans and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had beenoccasioned by the sausage eatershy have we stopped s the way blocked r have we already come upagainst the rencho one cant hear them heyd be firing if we hadhey were in a hurry enough to

thescoundrelse were ordered to be at the place before nine but we havent gothalfway ine orders was being repeated on different sidesnd the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began toturn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at theermanshe cause of the confusion was that while the ustrian cavalry wasmoving toward our left flank the higher command found that our centerwas too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were allordered to turn back to the right everal thousand cavalry crossed infront of the infantry who had to waitt the front an altercation occurred between an ustrian guide and aussian general he general shouted a demand that the cavalry should behalted the ustrian argued that not he but the higher command was toblame he troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited fteran hours delay they at last moved on descending the hill he fog thatwas dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below where they weredescending n front in the fog a shot was heard and then another atfirst irregularly at varying intervalstrata tatand then more andmore regularly and rapidly and the action at the oldbach tream beganot expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream and havingstumbled on him in the fog hearing no encouraging word from theircommanders and with a consciousness of being too late spreading throughthe ranks and above all being unable to see anything in front or aroundthem in the thick fog the ussians exchanged shots with the enemylazily and advanced and again halted receiving no timely orders fromthe officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknownsurroundings unable to find their own regiments n this way the actionbegan for the first second and third columns which had gone down intothe valley he fourth column with which utuzov was stood on theratzen eightselow where the fight was beginning there was still thick fog on thehigher ground it was clearing but nothing could be seen of what wasgoing on in front hether all the enemy forces were as we supposedsix miles away or whether they were near by in that sea of mist no oneknew till after eight oclockt was nine oclock in the morning he fog lay unbroken like a sea downbelow but higher up at the village of chlappanitz where apoleon stoodwith his marshals around him it was quite light bove him was a clearblue sky and the suns vast orb quivered like a huge hollow crimsonfloat on the surface of that milky sea of mist he whole rench armyand even apoleon himself with his staff were not on the far side ofthe streams and hollows of okolnitz and chlappanitz beyond which weintended to take up our position and begin the action but were on thisside so close to our own forces that apoleon with the naked eye coulddistinguish a mounted man from one on foot apoleon in the blue cloakwhich he had worn on his talian campaign sat on his small gray rabhorse a little in front of his marshals e gazed silently at the hillswhich seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the ussiantroops were moving in the distance and he listened to the sounds offiring in the valley ot a single muscle of his facewhich in thosedays was still thinmoved is gleaming eyes were fixed intently on onespot is predictions were being justified art of the ussian forcehad already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes andpart were leaving these ratzen eights which he intended to attack andregarded as the key to the position e saw over the mist that in ahollow between two hills near the village of ratzen the ussiancolumns their bayonets glittering were moving continuously in onedirection toward the valley and disappearing one after another into themist rom information he had received the evening before from thesound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night bythe disorderly movement of the ussian columns and from allindications he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far awayin front of them and that the columns moving near ratzen constitutedthe center of the ussian army and that that center was alreadysufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked ut still he did notbegin the engagementoday was a great day for himthe anniversary of his coronation eforedawn he had slept for a few hours and refreshed vigorous and in goodspirits he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happymood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds e satmotionless looking at the heights visible above the mist and his coldface wore that special look of confident selfcomplacent happiness thatone sees on the face of a boy happily in love he marshals stood behindhim not venturing to distract his attention e looked now at theratzen eights now at the sun floating up out of the misthen the sun had entirely emerged from the fog and fields and mist wereaglow with dazzling lightas if he had only awaited this to begin theactionhe drew the glove from his shapely white hand made a sign withit to the marshals and ordered the action to begin he marshalsaccompanied by adjutants galloped off in different directions and afew minutes later the chief forces of the rench army moved rapidlytoward those ratzen eights which were being more and more denuded byussian troops moving down the valley to their left t eight oclock utuzov rode to ratzen at the head of the fourthcolumn iloradovichs the one that was to take the place ofrzebyszewskis and angerons columns which had already gone down intothe valley e greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave themthe order to march thereby indicating that he intended to lead thatcolumn himself hen he had reached the village of ratzen he haltedrince ndrew was behind among the immense number forming thecommanderinchiefs suite e was in a state of suppressed excitementand irritation though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach ofa longawaited moment e was firmly convinced that this was the day ofhis oulon or his bridge of rcola ow it would come about he did notknow but he felt sure it would do so he locality and the position ofour troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone inour army is own strategic plan which obviously could not now becarried out was forgotten ow entering into eyrothers plan rincendrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such asmight call for his rapidity of perception and decisiono the left down below in the mist the musketry fire of unseen forcescould be heard t was there rince

whatever is in front of mee could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalionseeing them he kept thinking hat may be the very standard with which shall lead the armyn the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was ahoar frost now turning to dew but in the valleys it still lay like amilkwhite sea othing was visible in the valley to the left into whichour troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firingbove the heights was the dark clear sky and to the right the vast orbof the sun n front far off on the farther shore of that sea of mistsome wooded hills were discernible and it was there the enemy probablywas for something could be descried n the right the uards wereentering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now andthen a gleam of bayonets to the left beyond the village similar massesof cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist n front andbehind moved infantry he commanderinchief was standing at the end ofthe village letting the troops pass by him hat morning utuzov seemedworn and irritable he infantry passing before him came to a haltwithout any command being given apparently obstructed by something infronto order them to form into battalion columns and go round the villagehe said angrily to a general who had ridden up ont you understandyour excellency my dear sir that you must not

himself that there really were nosharpshooters in front of our columns he colonel at the head of theregiment was much surprised at the commanderinchiefs order to throwout skirmishers e had felt perfectly sure that there were other troopsin front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles awayhere was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descenthidden by dense mist aving given orders in the commanderinchiefsname to rectify this omission rince ndrew galloped back utuzovstill in the same place his stout body resting heavily in the saddlewith the lassitude of age sat yawning wearily with closed eyes hetroops were no longer moving but stood with the butts of their musketson the groundll right all right he said to rince ndrew and turned to ageneral who watch in hand was saying it was time they started as allthe leftflank columns had already descendedlenty of time your excellency muttered utuzov in the midst of ayawn lenty of time he repeatedust then at a distance behind utuzov was heard the sound of regimentssaluting and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extendedline of the advancing ussian columns vidently the person they weregreeting was riding quickly hen the soldiers of the regiment in frontof which utuzov was standing began to shout he rode a little to oneside and looked round with a frown long the road from ratzen gallopedwhat looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms wo of themrode side by side in front at full gallop ne in a black uniform withwhite plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse the other whowas in a white uniform rode a black one hese were the two mperorsfollowed by their suites utuzov affecting the manners of an oldsoldier at the front gave the command ttention and rode up to themperors with a salute is whole appearance and manner were suddenlytransformed e put on the air of a subordinate who obeys withoutreasoning ith an affectation of respect which evidently strucklexander unpleasantly he rode up and salutedhis unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy faceof the mperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanishedfter his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field oflmutz where olkonski had seen him for the first time abroad but therewas still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in hisfine gray eyes and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varyingexpression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocentyoutht the lmutz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemedbrighter and more energetic e was slightly flushed after galloping twomiles and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round atthe faces of his suite young and animated as his own

speak like that their glances seemed to sayhe sar looked intently and observantly into utuzovs eye waiting tohear whether he would say anything more ut utuzov with respectfullybowed head seemed also to be waiting he silence lasted for about aminuteowever if you command it our ajesty said utuzov lifting hishead and again assuming his former tone of a dull unreasoning butsubmissive generale touched his horse and having called iloradovich the commander ofthe column gave him the order to advancehe troops again began to move and two battalions of the ovgorod andone of the psheron regiment went forward past the mperors this psheron battalion marched by the redfaced iloradovichwithout his greatcoat with his rders on his breast and an enormoustuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side

wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a littlebehind the mperor he psheron men excited by the sars presencepassed in step before the mperors and their suites at a bold briskpaceads shouted iloradovich in a loud selfconfident and cheeryvoice obviously so elated by the sound of firing by the prospect ofbattle and by the sight of the gallant psherons his comrades inuvorovs time now passing so gallantly before the mperors that heforgot the sovereigns presence ads its not the first villageyouve had to take cried helad to do our best shouted the soldiershe mperors horse started at the sudden cry his horse that hadcarried the sovereign at reviews in ussia bore him also here on thefield of usterlitz enduring the heedless blows of his left foot andpricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on thempress ield not understanding the significance of the firing nor ofthe nearness of the mperor rancis black cob nor of all that wasbeing said thought and felt that day by its riderhe mperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made aremark to him pointing to the gallant psherons utuzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind thecarabineershen he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column hestopped at a solitary deserted house that had probably once been aninn where two roads parted oth of them led downhill and troops weremarching along bothhe fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visibleabout a mile and a half off on the opposite heights own below on theleft the firing became more distinct utuzov had stopped and wasspeaking to an ustrian general rince ndrew who was a little behindlooking at them turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glassook look said this adjutant looking not at the troops in thedistance but down the hill before him ts the renchhe two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass tryingto snatch it from one another he expression on all their facessuddenly changed to one of horror he rench were supposed to be a mileand a half away but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just infront of usts the enemy o es see it is for certain ut how isthat said different voicesith the naked eye rince ndrew saw below them to the right not morethan five hundred paces from where utuzov was standing a dense renchcolumn coming up to meet the psheronsere it is he decisive moment has arrived y turn has come thoughtrince ndrew and striking his horse he rode up to utuzovhe psherons must be stopped your excellency cried he ut at thatvery instant a cloud of smoke spread all round firing was heard quiteclose at hand and a voice of naive terror barely two steps from rincendrew shouted rothers lls lost nd at this as if at a commandeveryone began to runonfused and everincreasing crowds were running back to where fiveminutes before the troops had passed the mperors ot only would ithave been difficult to stop that crowd it was even impossible not to becarried back with it oneself olkonski only tried not to lose touchwith it and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what washappening in front of him esvitski with an angry face red and unlikehimself was shouting to utuzov that if he did not ride away at once hewould certainly be taken prisoner utuzov remained in the same placeand without answering drew out a handkerchief lood was flowing fromhis cheek rince ndrew forced his way to himou are wounded he asked hardly able to master the trembling of hislower jawhe wound is not here it is there said utuzov pressing thehandkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldierstop them he shouted and at the same moment probably realizing thatit was impossible to stop them spurred his horse and rode to the right fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with ithe troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded bythem it was difficult to get out again ne was shouting et on hyare you hindering us nother in the same place turned round and firedin the air a third was striking the horse utuzov himself rode avingby a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men utuzovwith his suite diminished by more than half rode toward a sound ofartillery fire near by aving forced his way out of the crowd offugitives rince ndrew trying to keep near utuzov saw on the slopeof the hill amid the smoke a ussian battery that was still firing andrenchmen running toward it igher up stood some ussian infantryneither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with thefleeing crowd  mounted general separated himself from the infantry andapproached utuzov f utuzovs suite only four remained hey were allpale and exchanged looks in silencetop those wretches gasped utuzov to the regimental commanderpointing to the flying soldiers but at that instant as if to punishhim for those words bullets flew hissing across the regiment and acrossutuzovs suite like a flock of little birdshe rench had attacked the battery and seeing utuzov were firing athim fter this volley the regimental commander clutched at his legseveral soldiers fell and a second lieutenant who was holding the flaglet it fall from his hands t swayed and fell but caught on themuskets of the nearest soldiers he soldiers started firing withoutordersh h h groaned utuzov despairingly and looked aroundolkonski he whispered his voice trembling from a consciousness ofthe feebleness of age olkonski he whispered pointing to thedisordered battalion and at the enemy whats thatut before he had finished speaking rince ndrew feeling tears ofshame and anger choking him had already leapt from his horse and run tothe standardorward lads he shouted in a voice piercing as a childsere it is thought he seizing the staff of the standard and hearingwith pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him everalsoldiers fellurrah shouted rince ndrew and scarcely able to hold up the heavystandard he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalionwould follow himnd really he only ran a few steps alone ne soldier moved and thenanother and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting urrah andovertook him  sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag thatwas swaying from its weight in rince ndrews hands but he wasimmediately killed rince ndrew again seized the standard anddragging it by the staff ran on with the battalion n front he saw ourartillerymen some of whom were fighting while others having abandonedtheir guns were running toward him e also saw rench infantrysoldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the gunsround rince ndrew and the battalion were already within twenty pacesof the cannon e heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly andto right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped uthe did not look at them he looked only at what was going on in front ofhimat the battery e now saw clearly the figure of a redhairedgunner with his shako knocked awry pulling one end of a mop while arench soldier tugged at the other e could distinctly see thedistraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men whoevidently did not realize what they were doinghat are they about thought rince ndrew as he gazed at them hydoesnt the redhaired gunner run away as he is unarmed hy doesnt therenchman stab him e will not get away before the renchman remembershis bayonet and stabs himnd really another rench soldier trailing his musket ran up to thestruggling men and the fate of the redhaired gunner who hadtriumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited himwas about to be decided ut rince ndrew did not see how it ended tseemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the headwith the full swing of a bludgeon t hurt a little but the worst of itwas that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he hadbeen looking athats this m  falling y legs are giving way thought he andfell on his back e opened his eyes hoping to see how the struggle ofthe renchmen with the gunners ended whether the redhaired gunner hadbeen killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or savedut he saw nothing bove him there was now nothing but the skythelofty sky not clear yet still immeasurably lofty with gray cloudsgliding slowly across it ow quiet peaceful and solemn not at allas  ran thought rince ndrewnot as we ran shouting and fightingnot at all as the gunner and the renchman with frightened and angryfaces struggled for the mop how differently do those clouds glideacross that lofty infinite sky ow was it  did not see that lofty skybefore nd how happy  am to have found it at last es ll is vanityall falsehood except that infinite sky here is nothing nothing butthat ut even it does not exist there is nothing but quiet and peacehank od n our right flank commanded by agration at nine oclock the battlehad not yet begun ot wishing to agree to olgorukovs demand tocommence the action and wishing to avert responsibility from himselfrince agration proposed to olgorukov to send to inquire of thecommanderinchief agration knew that as the distance between the twoflanks was more than six miles even if the messenger were not killedwhich he very likely would be and found the commanderinchief whichwould be very difficult he would not be able to get back beforeeveningagration cast his large expressionless sleepy eyes round his suiteand the boyish face ostov breathless with excitement and hope was thefirst to catch his eye e sent himnd if  should meet is ajesty before  meet the commanderinchiefyour excellency said ostov with his hand to his capou can give the message to is ajesty said olgorukov hurriedlyinterrupting agrationn being relieved from picket duty ostov had managed to get a fewhours sleep before morning and felt cheerful bold and resolute withelasticity of movement faith in his good fortune and generally in thatstate of mind which makes everything seem possible pleasant and easyll his wishes were being fulfilled that morning there was to be ageneral engagement in which he was taking part more than that he wasorderly to the bravest general and still more he was going with amessage to utuzov perhaps even to the sovereign himself he morningwas bright he had a good horse under him and his heart was full of joyand happiness n receiving the order he gave his horse the rein andgalloped along the line t first he rode along the line of agrationstroops which had not yet advanced into action but were standingmotionless then he came to the region occupied by varovs cavalry andhere he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle havingpassed varovs cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon andmusketry ahead of him he firing grew louder and loudern the fresh morning air were now heard not two or three musket shotsat irregular intervals as before followed by one or two cannon shotsbut a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill beforeratzen interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimesseveral of them were not separated from one another but merged into ageneral roare could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one anotherdown the hillsides and clouds of cannon smoke rolling spreading andmingling with one another e could also by the gleam of bayonetsvisible through the smoke make out moving masses of infantry and narrowlines of artillery with green caissonsostov stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was goingon but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or makeout anything of what was happening there in the smoke men of some sortwere moving about in front and behind moved lines of troops but whywhither and who they were it was impossible to make out hese sightsand sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him on thecontrary they stimulated his energy and determinationo on o on ive it them he mentally exclaimed at these sounds andagain proceeded to gallop along the line penetrating farther andfarther into the region where the army was already in actionow it will be there  dont know but all will be well thoughtostovfter passing some ustrian troops he noticed that the next part of theline the uards was already in actiono much the better  shall see it close he thoughte was riding almost along the front line  handful of men camegalloping toward him hey were our uhlans who with disordered rankswere returning from the attack ostov got out of their wayinvoluntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding and galloped onhat is no business of mine he thought e had not ridden manyhundred yards after that before he saw to his left across the wholewidth of the field an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant whiteuniforms mounted on black horses trotting straight toward him andacross his path ostov put his horse to full gallop to get out of theway of these men and he would have got clear had they continued at thesame speed but they kept increasing their pace so that some of thehorses were already galloping ostov heard the thud of their hoofs andthe jingle of their weapons and saw their horses their figures andeven their faces more and more distinctly hey were our orse uardsadvancing to attack the rench cavalry that was coming to meet themhe orse uards were galloping but still holding in their horsesostov could already see their faces and heard the command hargeshouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speedostov fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the renchgalloped along the front as hard as his horse could go but still wasnot in time to avoid themhe last of the orse uards a huge pockmarked fellow frowned angrilyon seeing ostov before him with whom he would inevitably collide hisuardsman would certainly have bowled ostov and his edouin overostov felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic menand horses had it not occurred to ostov to flourish his whip beforethe eyes of the uardsmans horse he heavy black horse sixteen handshigh shied throwing back its ears but the pockmarked uardsman drovehis huge spurs in violently and the horse flourishing its tail andextending its neck galloped on yet faster ardly had the orse uardspassed ostov before he heard them shout urrah and looking back sawthat their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry withred epaulets probably rench e could see nothing more forimmediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smokeenveloped everythingt that moment as the orse uards having passed him disappeared inthe smoke ostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go wherehe was sent his was the brilliant charge of the orse uards thatamazed the rench themselves ostov was horrified to hear later that ofall that mass of huge and handsome men of all those brilliant richyouths officers and cadets who had galloped past him on theirthousandruble horses only eighteen were left after the chargehy should  envy them y chance is not lost and maybe  shall seethe mperor immediately thought ostov and galloped onhen he came level with the oot uards he noticed that about them andaround them cannon balls were flying of which he was aware not so muchbecause he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on thesoldiers faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of theofficersassing behind one of the lines of a regiment of oot uards he heard avoice calling him by nameostovhat he answered not recognizing oris say weve been in the front line ur regiment attacked said oriswith the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been underfire for the first timeostov stoppedave you he said ell how did it goe drove them back said oris with animation growing talkative anyou imagine it and he began describing how the uards having taken uptheir position and seeing troops before them thought they wereustrians and all at once discovered from the cannon balls dischargedby those troops that they were themselves in the front line and hadunexpectedly to go into action ostov without hearing oris to the endspurred his horsehere are you off to asked orisith a message to is ajestyhere he is said oris thinking ostov had said is ighness andpointing to the rand uke who with his high shoulders and frowningbrows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and orseuards jacket shouting something to a pale white uniformed ustrianofficerut thats the rand uke and  want the commanderinchief or themperor said ostov and was about to spur his horseount ount shouted erg who ran up from the other side as eager asoris ount  am wounded in my right hand and he showed hisbleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it and  remained at thefront  held my sword in my left hand ount ll our familythe vonergshave been knightse said something more but ostov did not wait to hear it and rodeawayaving passed the uards and traversed an empty space ostov to avoidagain getting in front of the first line as he had done when the orseuards charged followed the line of reserves going far round the placewhere the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard uddenly heheard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troopswhere he could never have expected the enemy to behat can it be he thought he enemy in the rear of our armympossible nd suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himselfand for the issue of the whole battle ut be that what it may hereflected there is no riding round it now  must look for thecommander in chief here and if all is lost it is for me to perish withthe resthe foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over ostov was more andmore confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village ofratzen which was full of troops of all kindshat does it mean hat is it hom are they firing at ho is firingostov kept asking as he came up to ussian and ustrian soldiersrunning in confused crowds across his pathhe devil knows heyve killed everybody ts all up now he wastold in ussian erman and zech by the crowd of fugitives whounderstood what was happening as little as he didill the ermans shouted oneay the devil take themthe traitorsum enker diese ussen  muttered a erman ang these ussianseveral wounded men passed along the road and words of abuse screamsand groans mingled in a general hubbub then the firing died downostov learned later that ussian and ustrian soldiers had been firingat one anothery od hat does it all mean thought he nd here where at anymoment the mperor may see them ut no these must be only a handfulof scoundrels t will soon be over it cant be that it cant be nlyto get past them quicker quickerhe idea of defeat and flight could not enter ostovs head hough hesaw rench cannon and rench troops on the ratzen eights just where hehad been ordered to look for the commanderinchief he could not didnot wish to believe that ostov had been ordered to look for utuzov and the mperor near thevillage of ratzen ut neither they nor a single commanding officerwere there only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds eurged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds butthe farther he went the more disorganized they were he highroad onwhich he had come out was thronged with caleches carriages of allsorts and ussian and ustrian soldiers of all arms some wounded andsome not his whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under thedismal influence of cannon balls flying from the rench batteriesstationed on the ratzen eightshere is the mperor here is utuzov ostov kept asking everyone hecould stop but got no answer from anyonet last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answerh brother heyve all bolted long ago said the soldier laughingfor some reason and shaking himself freeaving left that soldier who was evidently drunk ostov stopped thehorse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began toquestion him he man announced that the sar had been driven in acarriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road andthat he was dangerously woundedt cant be said ostov t must have been someone else saw him myself replied the man with a selfconfident smile ofderision  ought to know the mperor by now after the times ve seenhim in etersburg  saw him just as  see you here he sat in thecarriage as pale as anything ow they made the four black horses flyracious me they did rattle past ts time  knew the mperial horsesand lya vanych  dont think lya drives anyone except the sarostov let go of the horse and was about to ride on when a woundedofficer passing by addressed himho is it you want he asked he commanderinchief e was killedby a cannon ballstruck in the breast before our regimentot killedwounded another officer corrected himho utuzov asked ostovot utuzov but whats his namewell never mind there are notmany left alive o that way to that village all the commanders arethere said the officer pointing to the village of osjeradek and hewalked onostov rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was nowgoing he mperor was wounded the battle lost t was impossible todoubt it now ostov rode in the direction pointed out to him in whichhe saw turrets and a church hat need to hurry hat was he now to sayto the sar or to utuzov even if they were alive and unwoundedake this road your honor that way you will be killed at once asoldier shouted to him heyd kill you thereh what are you talking about said another here is he to go hatway is nearerostov considered and then went in the direction where they said hewould be killedts all the same now f the mperor is wounded am  to try to savemyself he thought e rode on to the region where the greatest numberof men had perished in fleeing from ratzen he rench had not yetoccupied that region and the ussiansthe uninjured and slightlywoundedhad left it long ago ll about the field like heaps of manureon wellkept plowland lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to eachcouple of acres he wounded crept together in twos and threes and onecould hear their distressing screams and groans sometimes feignedorso it seemed to ostov e put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing allthese suffering men and he felt afraidafraid not for his life butfor the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight ofthese unfortunateshe rench who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead andwounded where there was no one left to fire at on seeing an adjutantriding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots hesensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses aroundhim merged in ostovs mind into a single feeling of terror and pity forhimself e remembered his mothers last letter hat would she feelthought he if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimedat men the village of osjeradek there were ussian troops retiring from thefield of battle who though still in some confusion were lessdisordered he rench cannon did not reach there and the musketry firesounded far away ere everyone clearly saw and said that the battle waslost o one whom ostov asked could tell him where the mperor orutuzov was ome said the report that the mperor was wounded wascorrect others that it was not and explained the false rumor that hadspread by the fact that the mperors carriage had really galloped fromthe field of battle with the pale and terrified berofmarschal ountolstoy who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in themperors suite ne officer told ostov that he had seen someone fromheadquarters behind the village to the left and thither ostov rodenot hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience hen he hadridden about two miles and had passed the last of the ussian troops hesaw near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it two men on horsebackfacing the ditch ne with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar toostov the other on a beautiful chestnut horse which ostov fancied hehad seen before rode up to the ditch struck his horse with his spursand giving it the rein leaped lightly over nly a little earth crumbledfrom the bank under the horses hind hoofs urning the horse sharplyhe again jumped the ditch and deferentially addressed the horseman withthe white plumes evidently suggesting that he should do the same herider whose figure seemed familiar to ostov and involuntarily rivetedhis attention made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and bythat gesture ostov instantly recognized his lamented and adoredmonarchut it cant be he alone in the midst of this empty field thoughtostov t that moment lexander turned his head and ostov saw thebeloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory he mperorwas pale his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow but the charm themildness of his features was all the greater ostov was happy in theassurance that the rumors about the mperor being wounded were false ewas happy to be seeing him e knew that he might and even ought to gostraight to him and give the message olgorukov had ordered him todeliverut as a youth in love trembles is unnerved and dares not utter thethoughts he has dreamed of for nights but looks around for help or achance of delay and flight when the longedfor moment comes and he isalone with her so ostov now that he had attained what he had longedfor more than anything else in the world did not know how to approachthe mperor and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would beinconvenient unseemly and impossible to do sohat t is as if  were glad of a chance to take advantage of hisbeing alone and despondent  strange face may seem unpleasant orpainful to him at this moment of sorrow besides what can  say to himnow when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight ofhim ot one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the mperor thathe had composed in his imagination could he now recall hose speecheswere intended for quite other conditions they were for the most part tobe spoken at a moment of victory and triumph generally when he wasdying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds andwhile dying he expressed the love his actions had provedesides how can  ask the mperor for his instructions for the rightflank now that it is nearly four oclock and the battle is lost ocertainly  must not approach him  must not intrude on hisreflections etter die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkindlook or bad opinion from him ostov decided and sorrowfully and witha heart full despair he rode away continually looking back at the sarwho still remained in the same attitude of indecisionhile ostov was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly awayaptain von oll chanced to ride to the same spot and seeing themperor at once rode up to him offered his services and assisted himto cross the ditch on foot he mperor wishing to rest and feelingunwell sat down under an apple tree and von oll remained beside himostov from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von oll spoke longand warmly to the mperor and how the mperor evidently weepingcovered his eyes with his hand and pressed von olls handnd  might have been in his place thought ostov and hardlyrestraining his tears of pity for the mperor he rode on in utterdespair not knowing where to or why he was now ridingis despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness wasthe cause of his griefe might not only might but should have gone up to the sovereign twas a unique chance to show his devotion to the mperor and he had notmade use of it hat have  done thought he nd he turned roundand galloped back to the place where he had seen the mperor but therewas no one beyond the ditch now nly some carts and carriages werepassing by rom one of the drivers he learned that utuzovs staff werenot far off in the village the vehicles were going to ostov followedthem n front of him walked utuzovs groom leading horses inhorsecloths hen came a cart and behind that walked an old bandylegged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coatit  say

onyaicholas and atasha but even the old countess whodreading thislove affair which might hinder icholas from making a brilliant matchblushed like a girlenisov to ostovs surprise appeared in the drawing room with pomadedhair perfumed and in a new uniform looking just as smart as he madehimself when going into battle and he was more amiable to the ladiesand gentlemen than ostov had ever expected to see him n his return to oscow from the army icholas ostov was welcomed byhis home circle as the best of sons a hero and their darlingikolenka by his relations as a charming attractive and polite youngman by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars a gooddancer and one of the best matches in the cityhe ostovs knew everybody in oscow he old count had money enoughthat year as all his estates had been remortgaged and so icholasacquiring a trotter of his own very stylish riding breeches of thelatest cut such as no one else yet had in oscow and boots of thelatest fashion with

something in his feelings for themperor not everyone could understand and with his whole soul he sharedthe adoration then common in oscow for the mperor who was spoken ofas the angel incarnateuring ostovs short stay in oscow before rejoining the army he didnot draw closer to onya but rather drifted away from her he was verypretty and sweet and evidently deeply in love with him but he was atthe period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no timefor that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and prizeshis freedom which he needs for so many other things hen he thought ofonya during this stay in oscow he said to himself h there willbe and there are many more such girls somewhere whom  do not yetknow here will be time enough to think about love when  want to butnow  have no time esides it seemed to him that the society of womenwas rather derogatory to his manhood e went to balls and into ladiessociety with an affectation of doing so against his will he

andfifty members of the nglish lub and fifty guests were awaiting theguest of honor and hero of the ustrian campaign rince agration todinnern the first arrival of the news of the battle of usterlitz oscow hadbeen bewildered t that time the ussians were so used to victoriesthat on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe itwhile others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange anevent n the nglish lub where all who were distinguished importantand well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive inecember nothing was said about the war and the last battle as thoughall were in a conspiracy of silence he men who set the tone inconversationount ostopchin rince uri olgorukov aluev ountarkov and rince yazemskidid not show themselves at the club butmet in private houses in intimate circles and the oscovites who tooktheir opinions from otherslya ostov among themremained for a whilewithout any definite opinion on the subject of the war and withoutleaders he oscovites felt that something was wrong and that todiscuss the bad news was difficult and so it was best to be silent utafter a while just as a jury comes out of its room the bigwigs whoguided the clubs opinion reappeared and everybody began speakingclearly and definitely easons were found for the incredible unheardof and impossible event of a ussian defeat everything became clearand in all corners of oscow the same things began to be said hesereasons were the treachery of the ustrians a defective commissariatthe treachery of the ole rzebyszewski and of the renchman angeronutuzovs incapacity and it was whispered the youth and inexperienceof the sovereign who had trusted worthless and insignificant peopleut the army the ussian army everyone declared was extraordinary andhad achieved miracles of valor he soldiers officers and generalswere heroes ut the hero of heroes was rince agration distinguishedby his chon rabern affair and by the retreat from usterlitz where healone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten back anenemy force twice as numerous as his own hat also conduced toagrations being selected as oscows hero was the fact that he had noconnections in the city and was a stranger there n his person honorwas shown to a simple fighting ussian soldier without connections andintrigues and to one who was associated by memories of the taliancampaign with the name of uvorov oreover paying such honor toagration was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike ofutuzovad there been no agration it would have been necessary to inventhim said the wit hinshin parodying the words of oltaire utuzov noone spoke of except some who abused him in whispers calling him acourt weathercock and an old satyrll oscow repeated rince olgorukovs saying f you go on modelingand modeling you must get smeared with clay suggesting consolation forour defeat by the memory of former victories and the words ofostopchin that rench soldiers have to be incited to battle byhighfalutin words and ermans by logical arguments to show them that itis more dangerous to run away than to advance but that ussian soldiersonly need to be restrained and held back n all sides new and freshanecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by ourofficers and men at usterlitz ne had saved a standard another hadkilled five renchmen a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded ergwas mentioned by those who did not know him as having when wounded inthe right hand taken his sword in the left and gone forward folkonski nothing was said and only those who knew him intimatelyregretted that he had died so young leaving a pregnant wife with hiseccentric father n that third of arch all the rooms in the nglish lub were filledwith a hum of

absentminded contempty his age he should have belonged to the younger men but by his wealthand connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests andso he went from one group to another

tothe nonsense talked by the ustrian generals hinshin standing closeby tried to make a joke saying that utuzov had evidently failed tolearn from uvorov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like acock but the elder members glanced severely at the wit making him feelthat in that place and on that day it was improper to speak so ofutuzovount lya ostov hurried and preoccupied went about in

grew louder hey drank to ekleshevaryshkin varov olgorukov praksin aluev to the committee toall the club members and to all the club guests and finally to ountlya ostov separately as the organizer of the banquet t that toastthe count took out his handkerchief and covering his face weptoutright ierre sat opposite olokhov and icholas ostov s usual he ate anddrank much and eagerly ut those who knew him intimately noticed thatsome great change had come over him that day e was silent all throughdinner and looked about blinking and scowling or with fixed eyes anda look of complete absentmindedness kept rubbing the bridge of hisnose is face was depressed and gloomy e seemed to see and hearnothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by somedepressing and unsolved problemhe unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by theprincess his cousin at oscow concerning olokhovs intimacy with hiswife and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning which inthe mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badlythrough his spectacles but that his wifes connection with olokhov wasa secret to no one but himself ierre absolutely disbelieved both theprincess hints and the letter but he feared now to look at olokhovwho was sitting opposite him very time he chanced to meet olokhovshandsome insolent eyes ierre felt something terrible and monstrousrising in his soul and turned quickly away nvoluntarily recalling hiswifes past and her relations with olokhov ierre saw clearly thatwhat was said in the letter might be true or might at least seem to betrue had it not referred to his wife e involuntarily remembered howolokhov who had fully recovered his former position after thecampaign had returned to etersburg and come to him vailing himselfof his friendly relations with ierre as a boon companion olokhov hadcome straight to his house and ierre had put him up and lent himmoney ierre recalled how elene had smilingly expressed disapproval ofolokhovs living at their house and how cynically olokhov had praisedhis wifes beauty to him and from that time till they came to oscow hadnot left them for a dayes he is very handsome thought ierre and  know him t would beparticularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me justbecause  have exerted myself on his behalf befriended him and helpedhim  know and understand what a spice that would add to the pleasureof deceiving me if it really were true es if it were true but  donot believe it  have no right to and cant believe it eremembered the expression olokhovs face assumed in his moments ofcruelty as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them intothe water or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason orshot a postboys horse with a pistol hat expression was often onolokhovs face when looking at him es he is a bully thoughtierre to kill a man means nothing to him t must seem to him thateveryone is afraid of him and that must please him e must think that too am afraid of himand in fact  am afraid of him he thoughtand again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soulolokhov enisov and ostov were now sitting opposite ierre andseemed very gay ostov was talking merrily to his two friends one ofwhom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rakeand every now and then he glanced ironically at ierre whosepreoccupied absentminded and massive figure was a very noticeable oneat the dinner ostov looked inimically at ierre first because ierreappeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian the husband of a beautyand in a wordan old woman and secondly because ierre in hispreoccupation and absentmindedness had not recognized ostov and hadnot responded to his greeting hen the mperors health was drunkierre lost in thought did not rise or lift his glasshat are you about shouted ostov looking at him in an ecstasy ofexasperation ont you hear its is ajesty the mperors healthierre sighed rose submissively emptied his glass and waiting tillall were seated again turned with his kindly smile to ostovhy  didnt recognize you he said ut ostov was otherwiseengaged he was shouting urrahhy dont you renew the acquaintance said olokhov to ostovonfound him hes a fool said ostovne should make up to the husbands of pretty women said enisovierre did not catch what they were saying but knew they were talkingabout him e reddened and turned awayell now to the health of handsome women said olokhov and with aserious expression but with a smile lurking at the corners of hismouth he turned with his glass to ierreeres to the health of lovely women eterkinand their lovers headdedierre with downcast eyes drank out of his glass without looking atolokhov or answering him he footman who was distributing leafletswith utuzovs cantata laid one before ierre as one of the principalguests e was just going to take it when olokhov leaning acrosssnatched it from his hand and began reading it ierre looked atolokhov and his eyes dropped the something terrible and monstrous thathad tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him eleaned his whole massive body across the tableow dare you take it he shoutedearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed esvitski and theneighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to ezukhovont ont hat are you about whispered their frightened voicesolokhov looked at ierre with clear mirthful cruel eyes and thatsmile of his which seemed to say h his is what  likeou shant have it he said distinctlyale with quivering lips ierre snatched the copyou you scoundrel  challenge you he ejaculated and pushingback his chair he rose from the tablet the very instant he did this and uttered those words ierre feltthat the question of his wifes guilt which had been tormenting him thewhole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative ehated her and was forever sundered from her espite enisovs requestthat he would take no part in the matter ostov agreed to be olokhovssecond and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel withesvitski ezukhovs second ierre went home but ostov with olokhovand enisov stayed on at the club till late listening to the gypsiesand other singersell then till tomorrow at okolniki said olokhov as he took leaveof ostov in the club porchnd do you feel quite calm ostov askedolokhov pausedell you see ll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two wordsf you are going to fight a duel and you make a will and writeaffectionate letters to your parents and if you think you may bekilled you are a fool and are lost for certain ut go with the firmintention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible andthen all will be right as our bear huntsman at ostroma used to tellme veryone fears a bear he says but when you see one your fearsall gone and your only thought is not to let him get away nd thatshow it is with me  demain mon cher  ill tomorrow my dear fellowext day at eight in the morning ierre and esvitski drove to theokolniki forest and found olokhov enisov and ostov already thereierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had noconnection with the matter in hand is haggard face was yellow e hadevidently not slept that night e looked about distractedly and screwedup his eyes as if dazzled by the sun e was entirely absorbed by twoconsiderations his wifes guilt of which after his sleepless night hehad not the slightest doubt and the guiltlessness of olokhov who hadno reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him should perhaps have done the same thing in his place thought ierrets even certain that  should have done the same then why this duelthis murder ither  shall kill him or he will hit me in the head orelbow or knee ant  go away from here run away bury myselfsomewhere passed through his mind ut just at moments when suchthoughts occurred to him he would ask in a particularly calm andabsentminded way which inspired the respect of the onlookers ill itbe long re things readyhen all was ready the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriersand the pistols loaded esvitski went up to ierre should not be doing my duty ount he said in timid tones andshould not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me inchoosing me for your second if at this grave this very grave moment did not tell you the whole truth  think there is no sufficient groundfor this affair or for blood to be shed over it ou were not rightnot quite in the right you were impetuoush yes it is horribly stupid said ierrehen allow me to express your regrets and  am sure your opponent willaccept them said esvitski who like the others concerned in theaffair and like everyone in similar cases did not yet believe that theaffair had come to an actual duel ou know ount it is much morehonorable to admit ones mistake than to let matters become irreparablehere was no insult on either side llow me to conveyo hat is there to talk about said ierre ts all the sames everything ready he added nly tell me where to go and where toshoot he said with an unnaturally gentle smilee took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of thetrigger as he had not before held a pistol in his handa fact that hedid not wish to confessh yes like that  know  only forgot said heo apologies none whatever said olokhov to enisov who on his sidehad been attempting a reconciliation and he also went up to theappointed placehe spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road wherethe sleighs had been left in a small clearing in the pine forestcovered with melting snow the frost having begun to break up during thelast few days he antagonists stood forty paces apart at the fartheredge of the clearing he seconds measuring the paces left tracks inthe deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing andesvitskis and olokhovs sabers which were stuck into the ground tenpaces apart to mark the barrier t was thawing and misty at fortypaces distance nothing could be seen or three minutes all had beenready but they still delayed and all were silent ell begin said olokhovll right said ierre still smiling in the same way  feeling ofdread was in the air t was evident that the affair so lightly beguncould no longer be averted but was taking its course independently ofmens willenisov first went to the barrier and announced s the advesawieshave wefused a weconciliation please pwoceed ake your pistols and atthe word thwee begin to advancene wo hwee he shouted angrily and stepped asidehe combatants advanced along the trodden tracks nearer and nearer toone another beginning to see one another through the mist hey had theright to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier olokhovwalked slowly without raising his pistol looking intently with hisbright sparkling blue eyes into his antagonists face is mouth woreits usual semblance of a smileo  can fire when  like said ierre and at the word three hewent quickly forward missing the trodden path and stepping into thedeep snow e held the pistol in his right hand at arms lengthapparently afraid of shooting himself with it is left hand he heldcarefully back because he wished to support his right hand with it andknew he must not do so aving advanced six paces and strayed off thetrack into the snow ierre looked down at his feet then quicklyglanced at olokhov and bending his finger as he had been shown firedot at all expecting so loud a report ierre shuddered at the sound andthen smiling at his own sensations stood still he smoke rendereddenser by the mist prevented him from seeing anything for an instantbut there was no second report as he had expected e only heardolokhovs hurried steps and his figure came in view through the smokee was pressing one hand to his left side while the other clutched hisdrooping pistol is face was pale ostov ran toward him and saidsomethingooo muttered olokhov through his teeth no its not over ndafter stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber he sank onthe snow beside it is left hand was bloody he wiped it on his coatand supported himself with it is frowning face was pallid andquiveredlea began olokhov but could not at first pronounce the wordlease he uttered with an effortierre hardly restraining his sobs began running toward olokhov andwas about to cross the space between the barriers when olokhov criedo your barrier and ierre grasping what was meant stopped by hissaber nly ten paces divided them olokhov lowered his head to thesnow greedily bit at it again raised his head adjusted himself drewin his legs and sat up seeking a firm center of gravity e sucked andswallowed the cold snow his lips quivered but his eyes still smilingglittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his remainingstrength e raised his pistol and aimedideways over yourself with your pistol ejaculated esvitskiover yourself even enisov cried to his adversaryierre with a gentle smile of pity and remorse his arms and legshelplessly spread out stood with his broad chest directly facingolokhov looked sorrowfully at him enisov ostov and esvitskiclosed their eyes t the same instant they heard a report andolokhovs angry cryissed shouted olokhov and he lay helplessly face downwards on thesnowierre clutched his temples and turning round went into the foresttrampling through the deep snow and muttering incoherent wordsolly folly eath lies he repeated puckering his faceesvitski stopped him and took him homeostov and enisov drove away with the wounded olokhovhe latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answera word to the questions addressed to him ut on entering oscow hesuddenly came to and lifting his head with an effort took ostov whowas sitting beside him by the hand ostov was struck by the totallyaltered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on olokhovsfaceell ow do you feel he askedad ut its not that my friend said olokhov with a gasping voicehere are we n oscow  know  dont matter but  have killed herkilled he wont get over it he wont surviveho asked ostovy mother y mother my angel my adored angel mother and olokhovpressed ostovs hand and burst into tearshen he had become a little quieter he explained to ostov that he wasliving with his mother who if she saw him dying would not survive ite implored ostov to go on and prepare herostov went on ahead to do what was asked and to his great surpriselearned that olokhov the brawler olokhov the bully lived in oscowwith an old mother and a hunchback sister and was the most affectionateof sons and brothers ierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone oth in etersburg and inoscow their house was always full of visitors he night after the duelhe did not go to his bedroom but as he often did remained in hisfathers room that huge room in which ount ezukhov had diede lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that hadhappened to him but could not do so uch a storm of feelingsthoughts and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fallasleep nor even remain in one place but had to jump up and pace theroom with rapid steps ow he seemed to see her in the early days oftheir marriage with bare shoulders and a languid passionate look onher face and then immediately he saw beside her olokhovs handsomeinsolent hard and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet andthen that same face pale quivering and suffering as it had been whenhe reeled and sank on the snowhat has happened he asked himself  have killed her lover yeskilled my wifes lover es that was it nd why ow did  come to doitecause you married her answered an inner voiceut in what was  to blame he asked n marrying her without lovingher in deceiving yourself and her nd he vividly recalled that momentafter supper at rince asilis when he spoke those words he had foundso difficult to utter  love you t all comes from that ven then felt it he thought  felt then that it was not so that  had noright to do it nd so it turns oute remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollectionarticularly vivid humiliating and shameful was the recollection ofhow one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into hisstudy a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his headsteward there who bowing respectfully looked into his face and at hisdressing gown and smiled slightly as if expressing respectfulunderstanding of his employers happinessut how often  have felt proud of her proud of her majestic beautyand social tact thought he been proud of my house in which shereceived all etersburg proud of her unapproachability and beauty othis is what  was proud of  then thought that  did not understandher ow often when considering her character  have told myself that was to blame for not understanding her for not understanding thatconstant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desiresand the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depravedwoman ow  have spoken that terrible word to myself all has becomeclearnatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss hernaked shoulders he did not give him the money but let herself bekissed er father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy and she repliedwith a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous et himdo what he pleases she used to say of me ne day  asked her if shefelt any symptoms of pregnancy he laughed contemptuously and said shewas not a fool to want to have children and that she was not going tohave any children by mehen he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and thevulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her though she hadbeen brought up in the most aristocratic circlesm not such a fool ust you try it on llezvous promener she used to say ften seeing the success she had with young and old menand women ierre could not understand why he did not love her ou clear out of thises  never loved her said he to himself  knew she was a depravedwoman he repeated but dared not admit it to myself nd now theresolokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dyingwhile meeting my remorse with some forced bravadoierre was one of those people who in spite of an appearance of what iscalled weak character do not seek a confidant in their troubles edigested his sufferings alonet is all all her fault he said to himself but what of that hydid  bind myself to her hy did  say e

his newfriends influencen the autumn the ostovs returned to oscow arly in the winterenisov also came back and stayed with them he first half of thewinter of  which icholas ostov spent in oscow was one of thehappiest merriest times for him and the whole family icholas broughtmany young men to his parents house era was a handsome girl oftwenty onya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening floweratasha half grown up and half child was now childishly amusing nowgirlishly enchantingt that time in the ostovs house there prevailed an amorous atmospherecharacteristic of homes where there are very young and very charminggirls very young man who came to the houseseeing thoseimpressionable smiling young faces smiling probably at their ownhappiness feeling the eager bustle around him and hearing the fitfulbursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle ofyoung girls ready for anything and full of hopeexperienced the samefeeling sharing with the young folk of the ostovs household areadiness to fall in love and an expectation of happinessmong the young men introduced by ostov one of the first was olokhovwhom everyone in the house liked except atasha he almost quarreledwith her brother about him he insisted that he was a bad man and thatin the duel with ezukhov ierre was right and olokhov wrong andfurther that he was disagreeable and unnaturalheres nothing for me to understand she cried out with resoluteselfwill he is wicked and heartless here now  like your enisovthough he is a rake and all that still  like him so you see  dounderstand  dont know how to put it with this one everything iscalculated and  dont like that ut enisovh enisov is quite different replied icholas implying that evenenisov was nothing compared to olokhovyou must understand what asoul there is in olokhov you should see him with his mother hat aheartell  dont know about that but  am uncomfortable with him nd doyou know he has fallen in love with onyahat nonsensem certain of it youll seeatashas prediction proved true olokhov who did not usually care forthe society of ladies began to come often to the house and thequestion for whose sake he came though no one spoke of it was soonsettled e came because of onya nd onya though she would neverhave dared to say so knew it and blushed scarlet every time olokhovappearedolokhov often dined at the ostovs never missed a performance atwhich they were present and went to ogels balls for young peoplewhich the ostovs always attended e was pointedly attentive to onyaand looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear hisglances without coloring but even the old countess and atasha blushedwhen they saw his lookst was evident that this strange strong man was under the irresistibleinfluence of the dark graceful girl who loved anotherostov noticed something new in olokhovs relations with onya but hedid not explain to himself what these new relations were heyrealways in love with someone he thought of onya and atasha ut hewas not as much at ease with onya and olokhov as before and was lessfrequently at homen the autumn of  everybody had again begun talking of the war withapoleon with even greater warmth than the year before rders weregiven to raise recruits ten men in every thousand for the regular armyand besides this nine men in every thousand for the militia verywhereonaparte was anathematized and in oscow nothing but the coming war wastalked of or the ostov family the whole interest of thesepreparations for war lay in the fact that icholas would not hear ofremaining in oscow and only awaited the termination of enisovsfurlough after hristmas to return with him to their regiment isapproaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself but rathergave zest to his pleasures e spent the greater part of his time awayfrom home at dinners parties and balls n the third day after hristmas icholas dined at home a thing he hadrarely done of late t was a grand farewell dinner as he and enisovwere leaving to join their regiment after piphany bout twenty peoplewere present including olokhov and enisovever had love been so much in the air and never had the amorousatmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the ostovs house as at thisholiday time eize the moments of happiness love and be loved hatis the only reality in the world all else is folly t is the one thingwe are interested in here said the spirit of the placeicholas having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses withoutvisiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invitedreturned home just before dinner s soon as he entered he noticed andfelt the tension of the amorous air in the house and also noticed acurious embarrassment among some of those present onya olokhov andthe old countess were especially disturbed and to a lesser degreeatasha icholas understood that something must have happened betweenonya and olokhov before dinner and with the kindly sensitivenessnatural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner nthat same evening there was to be one of the balls that ogel thedancing master gave for his pupils during the holidaysicholas will you come to ogels lease do said atasha e askedyou and asili mitrich  is also going enisovhere would  not go at the countess command said enisov who atthe ostovs had jocularly assumed the role of atashas knight meven weady to dance the pas de chalef  have time answered icholas ut  promised the rkharovs theyhave a partynd you he asked olokhov but as soon as he had asked the questionhe noticed that it should not have been puterhaps coldly and angrily replied olokhov glancing at onya andscowling he gave icholas just such a look as he had given ierre atthe club dinnerhere is something up thought icholas and he was further confirmedin this conclusion by the fact that olokhov left immediately afterdinner e called atasha and asked her what was the matternd  was looking for you said atasha running out to him  toldyou but you would not believe it she said triumphantly e hasproposed to onyaittle as icholas had occupied himself with onya of late somethingseemed to give way within him at this news olokhov was a suitable andin some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless orphan girl romthe point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of thequestion for her to refuse him nd therefore icholas first feeling onhearing the news was one of anger with onya e tried to sayhats capital of course shell forget her childish promises andaccept the offer but before he had time to say it atasha began againnd fancy she refused him quite definitely adding after a pauseshe told him she loved anotheres my onya could not have done otherwise thought icholasuch as amma pressed her she refused and

while he watched the youngpeople dancing ogel with atasha his pride and his best pupil werethe first couple oiselessly skillfully stepping with his little feetin low shoes ogel flew first across the hall with atasha who thoughshy went on carefully executing her steps enisov did not take hiseyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearlyindicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and notbecause he could not n the middle of a figure he beckoned to ostovwho was passinghis is not at all the thing he said hat sort of olish mazuwka isthis ut she does dance splendidlynowing that enisov had a reputation even in oland for the masterlyway in which he danced the mazurka icholas ran up to atashao and choose enisov e is a real dancer a wonder he saidhen it came to atashas turn to choose a partner she rose andtripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows rantimidly to the corner where enisov sat he saw that everybody waslooking at her and waiting icholas saw that enisov was refusingthough he smiled delightedly e ran up to themlease asili mitrich atasha was saying do comeh no let me off ountess enisov repliedow then aska said icholashey

chairs clasped hispartners hand firmly threw back his head and advanced his footwaiting for the beat nly on horse back and in the mazurka wasenisovs short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow hefelt himself to be t the right beat of the music he looked sideways athis partner with a merry and triumphant air suddenly stamped with onefoot bounded from the floor like a ball and flew round the room takinghis partner with him e glided silently on one foot half across theroom and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at themwhen suddenly clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs he stoppedshort on his heels stood so a second stamped on the spot clanking hisspurs whirled rapidly round and striking his left heel against hisright flew round again in a circle atasha guessed what he meant todo and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing howirst he spun her round holding her now with his left now with hisright hand then falling on one knee he twirled her round him and againjumping up dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he wouldrush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath and thenhe suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps hen atlast smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair he drewup with a click of his spurs and bowed to her atasha did not even makehim a curtsy he fixed her eyes on him in amazement smiling as if shedid not recognize himhat does this mean she brought outlthough ogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka everyonewas delighted with enisovs skill he was asked again and again as apartner and the old men began smilingly to talk about oland and thegood old days enisov flushed after the mazurka and mopping himselfwith his handkerchief sat down by atasha and did not leave her for therest of the evening or two days after that ostov did not see olokhov at his own or atolokhovs home on the third day he received a note from hims  do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know ofand am going to rejoin my regiment  am giving a farewell suppertonight to my friendscome to the nglish otelbout ten oclock ostov went to the nglish otel straight from thetheater where he had been with his family and enisov e was at onceshown to the best room which olokhov had taken for that evening ometwenty men were gathered round a table at which olokhov sat between twocandles n the table was a pile of gold and paper money and he waskeeping the bank ostov had not seen him since his proposal and onyasrefusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meetolokhovs clear cold glance met ostov as soon as he entered the dooras though he had long expected himts a long time since we met he said hanks for coming ll justfinish dealing and then lyushka will come with his chorus called once or twice at your house said ostov reddeningolokhov made no replyou may punt he saidostov recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once hadwith olokhov one but fools trust to luck in play olokhov had thensaidr are you afraid to play with me olokhov now asked as if guessingostovs thoughteneath his smile ostov saw in him the mood he had shown at the clubdinner and at other times when as if tired of everyday life he had felta need to escape from it by some strange and usually cruel actionostov felt ill at ease e tried but failed to find some joke withwhich to reply to olokhovs words ut before he had thought ofanything olokhov looking straight in his face said slowly anddeliberately so that everyone could hearo you remember we had a talk about cards es a fool who trusts toluck one should make certain and  want to tryo try his luck or the certainty ostov asked himselfell youd better not play olokhov added and springing a new packof cards said ank gentlemenoving the money forward he prepared to deal ostov sat down by hisside and at first did not play olokhov kept glancing at himhy dont you play he askednd strange to say icholas felt that he could not help taking up acard putting a small stake on it and beginning to play have no money with me he saidll trust youostov staked five rubles on a card and lost staked again and againlost olokhov killed that is beat ten cards of ostovs runningentlemen said olokhov after he had dealt for some time leaseplace your money on the cards or  may get muddled in the reckoningne of the players said he hoped he might be trustedes you might but  am afraid of getting the accounts mixed o  askyou to put the money on your cards replied olokhov ont stintyourself well settle afterwards he added turning to ostovhe game continued a waiter kept handing round champagnell ostovs cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored upagainst him e wrote  rubles on a card but while the waiterfilled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stakeof twenty rubleseave it said olokhov though he did not seem to be even looking atostov youll win it back all the sooner  lose to the others but winfrom you r are you afraid of me he asked againostov submitted e let the eight hundred remain and laid down a sevenof hearts with a torn corner which he had picked up from the floor ewell remembered that seven afterwards e laid down the seven of heartson which with a broken bit of chalk he had written  rubles in clearupright figures he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handedhim smiled at olokhovs words and with a sinking heart waiting for aseven to turn up gazed at olokhovs hands which held the pack uchdepended on ostovs winning or losing on that seven of hearts n theprevious unday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles andthough he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had toldicholas that this was all he could let him have till ay and asked himto be more economical this time icholas had replied that it would bemore than enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to takeanything more till the spring ow only twelve hundred rubles was leftof that money so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only theloss of sixteen hundred rubles but the necessity of going back on hisword ith a sinking heart he watched olokhovs hands and thought owthen make haste and let me have this card and ll take my cap anddrive home to supper with enisov atasha and onya and willcertainly never touch a card again t that moment his home life jokeswith etya talks with onya duets with atasha piquet with hisfather and even his comfortable bed in the house on the ovarskaya rosebefore him with such vividness clearness and charm that it seemed asif it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss long past e could notconceive that a stupid chance letting the seven be dealt to the rightrather than to the left might deprive him of all this happiness newlyappreciated and newly illumined and plunge him into the depths ofunknown and undefined misery hat could not be yet he awaited with asinking heart the movement of olokhovs hands hose broad reddishhands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs laid downthe pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed himo you are not afraid to play with me repeated olokhov and as ifabout to tell a good story he put down the cards leaned back in hischair and began deliberately with a smilees gentlemen ve

battlefield at the bridgeover the nns and then guessed that the card that came first to handfrom the crumpled heap under the table would save him now counted thecords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking thetotal of his losses on it then he looked round for aid from the otherplayers or peered at the now cold face of olokhov and tried to readwhat was passing in his minde

time begun to sing seriouslymainly because enisov so delighted in her singing he no longer sangas a child there was no longer in her singing that comical childishpainstaking effect that had been in it before but she did not yet singwell as all the connoisseurs who heard her said t is not trainedbut it is a beautiful voice that must be trained nly they generallysaid this some time after she had finished singing hile that untrainedvoice with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions wassounding even the connoisseurs said nothing but only delighted in itand wished to hear it again n her voice there was a virginalfreshness an unconsciousness of her own powers and an as yet untrainedvelvety softness which so mingled with her lack of art in singing thatit seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoilingithat is this thought icholas listening to her with widely openedeyes hat has happened to her ow she is singing today nd suddenlythe whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note thenext phrase and everything in the world was divided into three beatsh mio crudele affetto ne two three one two threene h mio crudele affetto ne two three ne h

inoscow ll enisovs oscow friends gave him a farewell entertainmentat the gypsies with the result that he had no recollection of how hewas put in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journeyfter enisovs departure ostov spent another fortnight in oscowwithout going out of the house waiting for the money his father couldnot at once raise and he spent most of his time in the girls

unworthy ofhere filled the girls albums with verses and music and having at lastsent olokhov the whole fortythree thousand rubles and received hisreceipt he left at the end of ovember without taking

reflectill you have the portmanteaus brought in nd a bed got ready andtea asked his valetierre gave no answer for he neither heard nor saw anything e hadbegun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the samequestionone so important that he took no notice of what went on aroundhim ot only was he indifferent as to whether he got to etersburgearlier or later or whether he secured accommodation at this stationbut compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a matter ofindifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for the restof his lifehe postmaster his wife the valet and a peasant woman selling orzhokembroidery came into the room offering their services ithout changinghis careless attitude ierre looked at them over his spectacles unableto understand what they wanted or how they could go on living withouthaving solved the problems that so absorbed him e had been engrossedby the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from okolniki afterthe duel and had spent that first agonizing sleepless night ut nowin the solitude of the journey they seized him with special force omatter what he thought about he always returned to these same questionswhich he could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself t wasas if the thread of the chief screw which held his life together werestripped so that the screw could not get in or out but went on turninguselessly in the same placehe postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency towait only two hours when come what might he would let his excellencyhave the courier horses t was plain that he was lying and only wantedto get more money from the travelers this good or bad ierre asked himself t is good for me bad foranother traveler and for himself its unavoidable because he needsmoney for food the man said an officer had once given him a thrashingfor letting a private traveler have the courier horses ut the officerthrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible nd continued ierre shot olokhov because  considered myself injuredand ouis  was executed because they considered him a criminal and ayear later they executed those who executed

anothertraveler also detained for lack of horseshe newcomer was a short largeboned yellowfaced wrinkled old manwith gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinitegrayish colorierre took his feet off the table stood up and lay down on a bed thathad been got ready for him glancing now and then at the newcomer whowith a gloomy and tired face was wearily taking off his wraps with theaid of his servant and not looking at ierre ith a pair of felt bootson his thin bony legs and keeping on a worn nankeencovered sheepskincoat the traveler sat down on the sofa leaned back his big head withits broad temples and closecropped hair and looked at ezukhov hestern shrewd and penetrating expression of that look struck ierre efelt a wish to speak to the stranger but by the time he had made up hismind to ask him a question about the roads the traveler had closed hiseyes is shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one ofthem ierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing adeaths head he stranger sat without stirring either resting or asit seemed to ierre sunk in profound and calm meditation is servantwas also a yellow wrinkled old man without beard or mustacheevidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grownhis active old servant was unpacking the travelers canteen andpreparing tea e brought in a boiling samovar hen everything wasready the stranger opened his eyes moved to the table filled atumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whomhe passed it ierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness and the

would bewanted o indicate he did not want more teao ive me the book said the strangerhe servant handed him a book which ierre took to be a devotional workand the traveler became absorbed in it ierre looked at him ll atonce the stranger closed the book putting in a marker and againleaning with his arms on the back of the sofa sat in his formerposition with his eyes shut ierre looked at him and had not time toturn away when the old man opening his eyes fixed his steady andsevere gaze straight on ierres faceierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look but the bright oldeyes attracted him irresistibly  have the pleasure of addressing ount ezukhov if  am notmistaken said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voiceierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles have

misfortune regret it very much my dear sirierre flushed and hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed bentforward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile have not referred to this out of curiosity my dear sir but forgreater reasonse paused his gaze still on ierre and moved aside on the sofa by wayof inviting the other to take a seat beside him ierre felt reluctantto enter into conversation with this old man but submitting to himinvoluntarily came up and sat down beside himou are unhappy my dear sir the stranger continued ou are youngand  am old  should like to help you as far as lies in my powerh yes said ierre with a forced smile  am very grateful to youhere are you traveling fromhe strangers face was not genial it was even cold and severe but inspite of this both the face and words of his new acquaintance wereirresistibly attractive to ierreut if for reason you dont feel inclined to talk to me said the oldman say so my dear sir nd he suddenly smiled in an unexpected andtenderly paternal wayh no not at all n the contrary  am very glad to make youracquaintance said ierre nd again glancing at the strangers handshe looked more closely at the ring with its skulla masonic signllow me to ask he said are you a asones  belong to the rotherhood of the reemasons said the strangerlooking deeper and deeper into ierres eyes nd in their name and myown  hold out a brotherly hand to you am afraid said ierre smiling and wavering between the confidencethe personality of the reemason inspired in him and his own habit ofridiculing the masonic beliefs am afraid  am very far fromunderstandinghow am  to put it am afraid my way of looking at theworld is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another know your outlook said the ason and the view of life

if had not known it  should not have addressed you our view of life is aregrettable delusionust as  may suppose you to be deluded said ierre with a faintsmile should never dare to say that  know the

not believe in odsaid ierre regretfully and with an effort feeling it essential tospeak the whole truthhe ason looked intently at ierre and smiled as a rich man withmillions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he poorman had not the five rubles that would make him happyes you do not know im my dear sir said the ason ou cannotknow im ou do not know im and that is why you are

at ierre but straight before him and turning the leaves ofhis book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keepstill f it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt  could bringhim to

not believe in the master who made it o know im ishard or ages from our forefather dam to our own day we labor toattain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim but inour lack of understanding we see only our weakness and isgreatnessierre listened with swelling heart gazing into the asons face withshining eyes not interrupting or questioning him but believing withhis whole soul what the stranger said hether he accepted the wisereasoning contained in the asons words or believed as a childbelieves in the speakers tone of conviction and earnestness or thetremor of the speakers voicewhich sometimes almost brokeor thosebrilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction or the calm firmnessand certainty of his vocation which radiated from his whole being andwhich struck ierre especially by contrast with his own dejection andhopelessnessat any rate ierre longed with his whole soul to believeand he did believe and felt a joyful sense of comfort regenerationand return

smilehe highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish toimbibe he said an  receive that pure liquid into an impure vesseland judge of its purity nly by the inner purification of

to him that he had been viciousonly because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous ota trace of his former doubts remained in his soul e firmly believed inthe possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim ofsupporting one another in the path of virtue and that is howreemasonry presented itself to him n reaching etersburg ierre did not let anyone know of his arrival hewent nowhere and spent whole days in reading homas a empis whose bookhad been sent him by someone unknown ne thing he continually realizedas he read that book the joy hitherto unknown to him of believing inthe possibility of attaining perfection and in the possibility ofactive brotherly love among men which oseph lexeevich had revealed tohim  week after his arrival the young olish count illarski whomierre had known slightly in etersburg society came into his room oneevening in the official and ceremonious manner in which olokhovssecond had called on him and having closed the door

illarski y carriage is at yourserviceillarski was silent throughout the drive o ierres inquiries as towhat he must do and how he should answer illarski only replied thatbrothers more worthy than he would test him and that ierre had only totell the truthaving entered the courtyard of a large house where the odge had itsheadquarters and having ascended a dark staircase they entered a smallwelllit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of aservant rom there they passed into another room  man in strangeattire appeared at the door illarski stepping toward him saidsomething to him in rench in an undertone and then went up to a smallwardrobe in which ierre noticed garments such as he had never seenbefore aving taken a kerchief from the cupboard illarski boundierres eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind catching some hairspainfully in the knot hen he drew his face down kissed him andtaking him by the hand led him forward he hairs tied in the knot hurtierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smileis huge figure with arms hanging down and with a puckered thoughsmiling face moved after illarski with uncertain timid stepsaving led him about ten

uncoveryour eyes added illarski  wish you courage and success andpressing ierres hand he went outeft alone ierre went on smiling in the same way nce or twice heshrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief as ifwishing to take it off but let it drop again he five minutes spentwith his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour is arms felt numb hislegs almost gave way it seemed to him that he was tired out eexperienced a variety of most complex sensations e felt afraid of whatwould happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear e feltcurious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed tohim but most of all he felt joyful that the moment had come when hewould at last start on that path of regeneration and on the activelyvirtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met osephlexeevich oud knocks were heard at the door ierre took the bandageoff his eyes and glanced around him he room was in black darknessonly a small lamp was burning inside something white ierre went nearerand saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open bookhe book was the ospel and the white thing with the lamp inside was ahuman skull with its cavities and teeth fter reading the first wordsof the ospel n the beginning was the ord and the ord was withod ierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled withsomething t was a coffin with bones inside e was not at allsurprised by what he saw oping to enter on an entirely new life quiteunlike the old one he expected everything to be unusual even moreunusual than what he was seeing  skull a coffin the ospelitseemed to him that he had expected all this and even more rying tostimulate his emotions he looked around od death love thebrotherhood of man he kept saying to himself associating these wordswith vague yet joyful ideas he door opened and someone came iny the dim light to which ierre had already become accustomed he sawa rather a short man aving evidently come from the light into thedarkness the man paused then moved with cautious steps toward thetable and placed on it his small leathergloved handshis short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest andpart of his legs he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a highwhite ruffle outlining his rather long face which was lit up frombelowor what have you come hither asked the newcomer turning in ierresdirection at a slight rustle made by the latter hy have you who donot believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the lightcome here hat do you seek from us isdom virtue enlightenmentt the moment the door opened and the stranger came in ierre felt asense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood atconfession he felt himself in the presence of one socially a completestranger yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man ith batedbreath and beating heart he moved toward the hetor by which name thebrother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the rotherhood wasknown rawing nearer he recognized in the hetor a man he knewmolyaninov and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was anacquaintancehe wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructoror a long time he could not utter a word so that the hetor had torepeat his questiones   desire regeneration ierre uttered with difficultyery well said molyaninov and went on at once ave you any ideaof the means by which our holy rder will help you to reach your aimsaid he quietly and quickly hope for guidance help in regeneration said ierrewith a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to hisexcitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters inussianhat is your conception of reemasonry imagine that reemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men whohave virtuous aims said ierre feeling ashamed of the inadequacy ofhis words for the solemnity of the moment as he spoke  imagineood said the hetor quickly apparently satisfied with this answerave you sought for means of attaining your aim in religiono  considered it erroneous and did not follow it said ierre sosoftly that the hetor did not hear him and asked him what he wassaying  have been an atheist answered ierreou are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your lifetherefore you seek wisdom and virtue s that not so said the hetorafter a moments pausees yes assented ierrehe hetor cleared his throat crossed his gloved hands on his breastand began to speakow  must disclose to you the chief aim of our rder he said andif this aim coincides with yours you may enter our rotherhood withprofit he first and chief object of our rder the foundation on whichit rests and which no human power can destroy is the preservation andhanding on to posterity of a certain important mystery which has comedown to us from the remotest ages even from the first mana mystery onwhich perhaps the fate of mankind depends ut since this mystery is ofsuch a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared bylong and diligent selfpurification not everyone can hope to attain itquickly ence we have a secondary aim that of preparing our members asmuch as possible to reform their hearts to purify and enlighten theirminds by means handed on to us by tradition from those who have strivento attain this mystery and thereby to render them capable of receivingity purifying and regenerating our members we try thirdly to improvethe whole human race offering it in our members an example of piety andvirtue and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil whichsways the world hink this over and  will come to you againo combat the evil which sways the world ierre repeated and amental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his minde imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago and headdressed an edifying exhortation to them e imagined to himselfvicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deedimagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue f the three objectsmentioned by the hetor this last that of improving mankindespecially appealed to ierre he important mystery mentioned by thehetor though it aroused his curiosity did not seem to him essentialand the second aim that of purifying and regenerating himself did notmuch interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that hewas already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for allthat was goodalf an hour later the hetor returned to inform the seeker of theseven virtues corresponding to the seven steps of olomons templewhich every reemason should cultivate in himself hese virtues were iscretion the keeping of the secrets of the rder  bedience tothose of higher ranks in the rder  orality  ove of mankind ourage  enerosity  he love of deathn the seventh place try by the frequent thought of death thehetor said to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe butas a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue fromthis distressful life and leads it to its place of recompense andpeacees that must be so thought ierre when after these words thehetor went away leaving him to solitary meditation t must be sobut  am still so weak that  love my life the meaning of which is onlynow gradually opening before me ut five of the other virtues whichierre recalled counting them on his fingers he felt already in hissoul courage generosity morality love of mankind and especiallyobediencewhich did not even seem to him a virtue but a joy e nowfelt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his willto those who knew the indubitable truth e forgot what the seventhvirtue was and could not recall ithe third time the hetor came back more quickly and asked ierrewhether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit toall that would be required of him am ready for everything said ierre must also inform you said the hetor that our rder delivers itsteaching not in words only but also by other means which may perhapshave a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtuethan mere words his chamber with what you see therein should alreadyhave suggested to your heart if it is sincere more than words coulddo ou will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like methodof enlightenment ur rder imitates the ancient societies thatexplained their teaching by hieroglyphics  hieroglyph said thehetor is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses butwhich possesses qualities resembling those of the symbolierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was but dared not speak elistened to the hetor in silence feeling from all he said that hisordeal was about to beginf you are resolved  must begin your initiation said the hetorcoming closer to ierre n token of generosity  ask you to give meall your valuablesut  have nothing here replied ierre supposing that he was askedto give up all he possessedhat

of obedience  ask you to undressierre took off his coat waistcoat and left boot according to thehetors instructions he ason drew the shirt back from ierres leftbreast and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers toabove the knee ierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot alsoand was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger thetrouble but the ason told him that was not necessary and gave him aslipper for his left foot ith a childlike smile of embarrassmentdoubt and selfderision which appeared on his face against his willierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart before hisbrother hetor and awaited his further commandsnd now in token of candor  ask you to reveal to me your chiefpassion said the lattery passion  have had so many replied ierrehat passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the pathof virtue said the asonierre paused seeking a replyine luttony dleness aziness rritability nger omen ewent over his vices in his mind not knowing to which of them to givethe preeminenceomen he said in a low scarcely audible voicehe ason did not move and for a long time said nothing after thisanswer t last he moved up to ierre and taking the kerchief that layon the table again bound his eyesor the last time  say to youturn all your attention upon yourselfput a bridle on your senses and seek blessedness not in passion but inyour own heart he source of blessedness is not without us butwithinierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing sourceof blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion oon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch ierre notthe hetor but ierres sponsor illarski whom he recognized by hisvoice o fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution ierrereplied es yes  agree and with a beaming childlike smile hisfat chest uncovered stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered andone booted foot he advanced while illarski held a sword to his barechest e was conducted from that room along passages that turnedbackwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of theodge illarski coughed he was answered by the masonic knock withmallets the doors opened before them  bass voice ierre was stillblindfolded questioned him as to who he was when and where he wasborn and so on hen he was again led somewhere still blindfolded andas they went along he was told allegories of the toils of hispilgrimage of holy friendship of the ternal rchitect of theuniverse and of the courage with which he should endure toils anddangers uring these wanderings ierre noticed that he was spoken ofnow as the eeker now as the ufferer and now as the ostulantto the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords s hewas being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertaintyamong his conductors e heard those around him disputing in whispersand one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpetfter that they took his right hand placed it on something and toldhim to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other handand to repeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to thelaws of the rder he candles were then extinguished and some spiritlighted as ierre knew by the smell and he was told that he would nowsee the lesser light he bandage was taken off his eyes and by thefaint light of the burning spirit ierre as in a dream saw severalmen standing before him wearing aprons like the hetors and holdingswords in their hands pointed at his breast mong them stood a manwhose white shirt was stained with blood n seeing this ierre movedforward with his breast toward the swords meaning them to pierce itut the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once blindfoldedagainow thou hast seen the lesser light uttered a voice hen the candleswere relit and he was told that he would see the full light the bandagewas again removed and more than ten voices said together ic transitgloria mundiierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the roomand at the people in it ound a long table covered with black sat sometwelve men in garments like those he had already seen ome of themierre had met in etersburg society n the residents chair sat ayoung man he did not know with a peculiar cross hanging from his neckn his right sat the talian abbe whom ierre had met at nna

who held amallet in his hand et into the wall was a starshaped light t oneside of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked uponit at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay aestament and a skull ound it stood seven large candlesticks likethose used in churches wo of the brothers led ierre up to the altarplaced his feet at right angles and bade him lie down saying that hemust prostrate himself at the ates of the emplee must first receive the trowel whispered one of the brothersh hush please said anotherierre perplexed looked round with his shortsighted eyes withoutobeying and suddenly doubts arose in his mind here am  hat am doing rent they laughing at me hant  be ashamed to rememberthis ut these doubts only lasted a moment ierre glanced at theserious faces of those around remembered all he had already gonethrough and realized that he could not stop halfway e was aghast athis hesitation and trying to arouse his former devotional feelingprostrated himself before the ates of the emple nd really thefeeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before henhe had lain there some time he was told to get up and a white leatherapron such as the others wore was put on him he was given a troweland three pairs of gloves and then the rand aster addressed him etold him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of thatapron which symbolized strength and purity then of the unexplainedtrowel he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from viceand indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor s to thefirst pair of gloves a mans he said that ierre could not know theirmeaning but must keep them he second pair of mans gloves he was towear at the meetings and finally of the third a pair of womensgloves he said ear brother these womans gloves are intended foryou too ive them to the woman whom you shall honor most of all hisgift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select tobe your worthy helpmeet in asonry nd after a pause he added utbeware dear brother that these gloves do not deck hands that areunclean hile the rand aster said these last words it seemed toierre that he grew embarrassed ierre himself grew still moreconfused blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes beganlooking about him uneasily and an awkward pause followedhis silence was broken by one of the brethren who led ierre up to therug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation ofall the figures on it the sun the moon a hammer a plumb line atrowel a rough stone and a squared stone a pillar three windows andso on hen a place was assigned to ierre he was shown the signs ofthe odge told the password and at last was permitted to sit down herand aster began reading the statutes hey were very long andierre from joy agitation and embarrassment was not in a state tounderstand what was being read e managed to follow only the last wordsof the statutes and these remained in his mindn our temples we recognize no other distinctions read the randaster but those between virtue and vice eware of making anydistinctions which may infringe equality ly to a

ancient dignity whichthou hast loste finished and getting up embraced and kissed ierre who with tearsof joy in his eyes looked round him not knowing how to answer thecongratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on allsides e acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men onlybrothers and burned with impatience to set to work with themhe rand aster rapped with his mallet ll the asons sat down intheir places and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity ofhumilityhe rand aster proposed that the last duty should be performed andthe distinguished dignitary who bore the title of ollector of lmswent round to all the brothers ierre would have liked to subscribe allhe had but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the sameamount as the othershe meeting was at an end and on reaching home ierre felt as if he hadreturned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years hadbecome completely changed and had quite left behind his former habitsand way of life he day after he had been received into the odge ierre was sitting athome reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the quareone side of which symbolized od another moral things a third physicalthings and the fourth a combination of these ow and then hisattention wandered from the book and the quare and he formed inimagination a new plan of life n the previous evening at the odge hehad heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the mperor and that itwould be wiser for him to leave etersburg ierre proposed going to hisestates in the south and there attending to the welfare

eneral ennigsen doesnot quite see it more particularly as it is he and his corps who arewithin sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity tofight a battle on his own hand as the ermans say e does so his isthe battle of ultusk which is considered a great victory but in myopinion was nothing of the kind e civilians as you know have a verybad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost hose who retreatafter a battle have lost it is what we say and according to that it iswe who lost the battle of ultusk n short we retreat after the battlebut send a courier to etersburg with news of a victory and eneralennigsen hoping to receive from etersburg the post of commander inchief as a reward for his victory does not give up the command of thearmy to eneral uxhowden uring

seniority should be our chief oenergetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordableriver we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy who atthe moment is not onaparte but uxhowden eneral uxhowden was all butattacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one ofthese maneuvers that enabled us to escape him uxhowden pursues uswescuttle e hardly crosses the

turn our thoughts to thesecond onaparte ut as it turns out just at that moment a thirdenemy rises before usnamely the rthodox ussian soldiers loudlydemanding bread meat biscuits fodder and whatnot he stores areempty the roads impassable he rthodox begin looting and in a way ofwhich our last campaign can give you no idea alf the regiments formbands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and swordhe inhabitants are totally ruined the hospitals overflow with sickand famine is everywhere wice the marauders even attack ourheadquarters and the commanderinchief has to ask for a battalion todisperse them uring one of these attacks they carried off my emptyportmanteau and my dressing gown he mperor proposes to give allcommanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders but  much fearthis will oblige one half the army to shoot the othert first rince ndrew read with his eyes only but after a while inspite of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trustilibin what he had read began to interest him more and more hen hehad read thus far he crumpled the letter up and threw it away t wasnot what he had read that vexed him but the fact that the life outthere in which he had now no part could perturb him e shut his eyesrubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he hadread and listened to what was passing in the nursery uddenly hethought he heard a strange noise through the door e was seized withalarm lest something should have happened to the child while he wasreading the letter e went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened itust as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from himwith a scared look and that rincess ary was no longer by the coty dear he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behindhims often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety he wasseized by an unreasoning panicit occurred to him that the child wasdead ll that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terrorll is over he thought and a cold sweat broke out on his foreheade went to the cot in confusion sure that he would find it empty andthat the nurse had been hiding the dead baby e drew the curtain asideand for some time his frightened restless eyes could not find the babyt last he saw him the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across thebed with his head lower than the pillow and was smacking his lips inhis sleep and breathing evenlyrince ndrew was as glad to find the boy like that as if he hadalready lost him e bent over him and as his sister had taught himtried with his lips whether the child was still feverish he softforehead was moist rince ndrew touched the head with his hand eventhe hair was wet so profusely had the child perspired e was not deadbut evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent rince ndrewlonged to snatch up to squeeze to hold to his heart this helplesslittle creature but dared not do so e stood over him gazing at hishead and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket eheard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of thecot e did not look round but still gazing at the infants facelistened to his regular breathing he dark shadow was rincess arywho had come up to the cot with noiseless steps lifted the curtain anddropped it again behind her rince ndrew recognized her withoutlooking and held out his hand to her he pressed ite has perspired said rince ndrew was coming to tell you sohe child moved slightly in his sleep smiled and rubbed his foreheadagainst the pillowrince ndrew looked at his sister n the dim shadow of the curtain herluminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy thatwere in them he leaned over to her brother and kissed him slightlycatching the curtain of the cot ach made the other a warning gestureand stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishingto leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all theworld rince ndrew was the first to move away ruffling his hairagainst the muslin of the curtaines this is the one thing left me now he said with a sigh oon after his admission to the masonic rotherhood ierre went to theiev province where he had the greatest number of serfs taking withhim full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as towhat he should do on his estateshen he reached iev he sent for all his stewards to the head office andexplained to them his intentions and wishes e told them that stepswould be taken immediately to free his serfsand that till then theywere not to be overburdened with labor women while nursing their babieswere not to be sent to work assistance was to be given to the serfspunishments were to be admonitory and not corporal and hospitalsasylums and schools were to be established on all the estates ome ofthe stewards there were semiliterate foremen among them listened withalarm supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeasedwith their management and embezzlement of money some after their firstfright were amused by ierres lisp and the new words they had not heardbefore others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked while thecleverest among them including the chief steward understood from thisspeech how they could best handle the master for their own endshe chief steward expressed great sympathy with ierres intentions butremarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into thegeneral state of affairs which was far from satisfactoryespite ount ezukhovs enormous wealth since he had come into anincome which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a yearierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him anallowance of ten thousand rubles e had a dim perception of thefollowing budgetbout  went in payments on all the estates to the and ank about went for the upkeep of the estate near oscow the town houseand the allowance to the three princesses about  was given inpensions and the same amount for asylums  alimony was sent tothe countess about  went for interest on debts he building of anew church previously begun had cost about  in each of the lasttwo years and he did not know how the rest about  rubles wasspent and almost every year he was obliged to borrow esides this thechief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests orof the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops o the firsttask ierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude orinclinationpractical businesse discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward ut hefelt that this did not forward matters at all e felt that theseconsultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up withthem or make them move n the one hand the chief steward put the stateof things to him in the very worst light pointing out the necessity ofpaying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor towhich ierre did not agree n the other hand ierre demanded thatsteps should be taken to liberate the serfs which the steward met byshowing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the and ankand the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipationhe steward did not say it was quite impossible but suggested sellingthe forests in the province of ostroma the land lower down the riverand the rimean estate in order to make it possible all of whichoperations according to him were connected with such complicatedmeasuresthe removal of injunctions petitions permits and so onthat ierre became quite bewildered and only repliedes yes do soierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled himto attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only triedto pretend to the steward that he was attending to it he steward forhis part tried to pretend to the count that he considered theseconsultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome tohimselfn iev ierre found some people he knew and strangers hastened to makehis acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer the largestlandowner of the province emptations to ierres greatest weaknessthe one to which he had confessed when admitted to the odgewere sostrong that he could not resist them gain whole days weeks andmonths of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupiedwith evening parties dinners lunches and balls giving him no timefor reflection as in etersburg nstead of the new life he had hopedto lead he still lived the old life only in new surroundingsf the three precepts of reemasonry ierre realized that he did notfulfill the one which enjoined every ason to set an example of morallife and that of the seven virtues he lacked twomorality and the loveof death e consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled anotherof the preceptsthat of reforming the human raceand had othervirtueslove of his neighbor and especially generosityn the spring of  he decided to return to etersburg n the way heintended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his ordershad been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom od hadentrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefithe chief steward who considered the young counts attempts almostinsaneunprofitable to himself to the count and to the serfsmadesome concessions ontinuing to represent the liberation of the serfs asimpracticable he arranged for the erection of large buildingsschoolshospitals and asylumson all the estates before the master arrivedverywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes which heknew ierre would not like but for just such gratefully religiousones with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality asaccording to his understanding of his master would touch and deludehimhe southern spring the comfortable rapid traveling in a iennacarriage and the solitude of the road all had a gladdening effect onierre he estates he had not before visited were each more picturesquethan the other the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchinglygrateful for the benefits conferred on them verywhere were receptionswhich though they embarrassed ierre awakened a joyful feeling in thedepth of his heart n one place the peasants presented him with breadand salt and an icon of aint eter and aint aul asking permissionas a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on themto build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor ofeter and aul his patron saints n another place the women withinfants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard workn a third estate the priest bearing a cross came to meet himsurrounded by children whom by the counts generosity he wasinstructing in reading writing and religion n all his estates ierresaw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erectionall on one plan for hospitals schools and almshouses which were soonto be opened verywhere he saw the stewards accounts according towhich the serfs manorial labor had been diminished and heard thetouching thanks of deputations of serfs in their fullskirted bluecoatshat ierre did not know was that the place where they presented himwith bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of eter andaul was a market village where a fair was held on t eters day andthat the richest peasants who formed the deputation had begun thechantry long before but that nine tenths of the peasants in thatvillages were in a state of the greatest poverty e did not know thatsince the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land theydid still harder work on their own land e did not know that the priestwho met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions andthat the pupils parents wept at having to let him take their childrenand secured their release by heavy payments e did not know that thebrick buildings built to plan were being built by serfs whose manoriallabor was thus increased though lessened on paper e did not know thatwhere the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs paymentshad been diminished by a third their obligatory manorial work had beenincreased by a half nd so ierre was delighted with his visit to hisestates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had leftetersburg and wrote enthusiastic letters to his brotherinstructoras he called the rand asterow easy it is how little effort it needs to do so much goodthought ierre and how little attention we pay to ite was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed atreceiving it his gratitude reminded him of how much more he might dofor these simple kindly peoplehe chief steward a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectlythrough the naive and intelligent count and played with him as with atoy seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on ierrepressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above allthe uselessness of freeing the serfs who were quite happy as it wasierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would bedifficult to imagine happier people and that od only knew what wouldhappen to them when they were free but he insisted though reluctantlyon what he thought right he steward promised to do all in his power tocarry out the counts wishes seeing clearly that not only would thecount never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken forthe sale of the land and forests and to release them from the and ankbut would probably never even inquire and would never know that thenewly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continuedto give in money and work all that other peoples serfs gavethat is tosay all that could be got out of them eturning from his journey through outh ussia in the happiest state ofmind ierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting hisfriend olkonski whom he had not seen for two yearsogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fieldsand forests of fir and birch which were partly cut down he house laybehind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banksstill bare of grass t was at the end of a village that stretched alongthe highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few firtreeshe homestead consisted of a threshing floor outhouses stables abathhouse a lodge and a large brick house with semicircular facadestill in course of construction ound the house was a garden newly laidout he fences and gates were new and solid two fire pumps and a watercart painted green stood in a shed the paths were straight thebridges were strong and had handrails verything bore an impress oftidiness and good management ome domestic serfs ierre met in replyto inquiries as to where the prince lived pointed out a small newlybuilt lodge close to the pond nton a man who had looked after rincendrew in his boyhood helped ierre out of his carriage said that theprince was at home and showed him into a clean little anteroomierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house afterthe brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend inetersburge quickly entered the small reception room with its stillunplasteredwooden walls redolent of pine and would have gone farther but ntonran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a doorell what is it came a sharp unpleasant voice visitor answered ntonsk him to wait and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed backierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to facewith rince ndrew who came out frowning and looking old ierreembraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheekand looked at him closelyell  did not expect you  am very glad said rince ndrewierre said nothing he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise ewas struck by the change in him is words were kindly and there was asmile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull and lifeless and inspite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous andglad sparkle rince ndrew had grown thinner paler and more manlylooking but what amazed and estranged ierre till he got used to itwere his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolongedconcentration on some one thoughts is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separationit was long before their conversation could settle on anything hey putquestions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to betalked over at length t last the conversation gradually settled onsome of the topics at first lightly touched on their past life plansfor the future ierres journeys and occupations the war and so onhe preoccupation and despondency which ierre had noticed in hisfriends look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile withwhich he listened to ierre especially when he spoke with joyfulanimation of the past or the future t was as if rince ndrew wouldhave liked to sympathize with what ierre was saying but could not helatter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of hisenthusiasms dreams and hopes of happiness or goodness in rincendrews presence e was ashamed to express his new masonic viewswhich had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late toure checked himself fearing to seem naive yet he felt an irresistibledesire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quitedifferent and better ierre than he had been in etersburg cant tell you how much  have lived through since then  hardlyknow myself againes we have altered much very much since then said rince ndrewell and you hat are your planslans repeated rince ndrew ironically y plans he said as ifastonished at the word ell you see m building  mean to settlehere altogether next yearierre looked silently

been doing on your estatesierre began describing what he had done on his estates trying as faras possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had beenmade rince ndrew several times prompted ierres story of what he hadbeen doing as though it were all an oldtime story and he listened notonly without interest but even as if ashamed of what ierre was tellinghimierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friends company andat last became silentll tell you what my dear fellow said rince ndrew who evidentlyalso felt depressed and constrained with his visitor  am

whom henow found nothing in common e will go after dinner nd would you nowlike to look round my placehey went out and walked about till dinnertime talking of the politicalnews and common acquaintances

and error are there in it if people were dyingof disease without help while material assistance could so easily berendered and  supplied them with a doctor a hospital and an asylumfor the aged nd is it not a palpable unquestionable good if apeasant or a woman with a baby has no rest day or night and  givethem rest and leisure said ierre hurrying and lisping nd  havedone that though badly and to a small extent but  have done somethingtoward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action andmore than that you cant make me believe that you do not think soyourself nd the main thing is he continued that  know and knowfor certain that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only surehappiness in lifees if you put it like that its quite a different matter saidrince ndrew  build a house and lay out a garden and you buildhospitals he one and the other may serve as a pastime ut whatsright and whats good must be judged by one who knows all but not byus ell you want an argument he

so forth that is you wantto raise him pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off hiscap from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs whileit seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible andthat is just what you want to deprive him of  envy him but you wantto make him what  am without giving him my means hen you saylighten his toil ut as  see it physical labor is as essential tohim as much a condition of his existence as mental activity is to youor me ou cant help thinking  go to bed after two in the morningthoughts come and  cant sleep but toss about till dawn because think and cant help thinking just as he cant help plowing and mowingif he didnt he would go to the drink shop or fall ill ust as  couldnot stand his terrible physical labor but

besides what anotion that medicine ever cured anyone illed them yes said hefrowning angrily and turning away from ierrerince ndrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it wasevident he had reflected on this subject more than once and he spokereadily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time isglance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopelessh that is dreadful dreadful said ierre  dont understand howone can live with such ideas  had such moments myself not long ago inoscow and when traveling but at such times  collapsed so that  dontlive at alleverything seems hateful to me myself most of all hen dont eat dont wash and how is it with youhy not wash hat is not cleanly said rince ndrew on thecontrary one must try to make ones life as pleasant as possible malive that is not my fault so  must live out my life as best  canwithout hurting othersut with such ideas what motive have you for living ne would sitwithout moving undertaking nothingife as it is leaves one no peace  should be thankful to do nothingbut here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor tochoose me to be their marshal it was all  could do to get out of ithey could not understand that  have not the necessary qualificationsfor itthe kind of goodnatured fussy shallowness necessary for theposition hen theres this house which must be built in

composure nowtheres this recruiting y father is chief in command of the hirdistrict and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve underhimhen you are serving ame paused a little whilend why do you servehy for this reason y father is one of the most remarkable men ofhis time ut he is growing old and though not exactly cruel he has tooenergetic a character e is so accustomed to unlimited power that he isterrible and now he has this authority of a commanderinchief of therecruiting granted by the mperor f  had been two hours late afortnight ago he would have had a paymasters clerk at

seees but it is not as you imagine rince ndrew continued  didnot and do not in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk whohad stolen some boots from the recruits  should even have been veryglad to see him hanged but  was sorry for my fatherthat again is formyselfrince ndrew grew more and more animated is eyes glittered feverishlywhile he tried to prove to ierre that in his actions there was nodesire to do good to his neighborhere now you wish to liberate your serfs he continued that is avery good thing but not for you dont suppose you ever had anyoneflogged or sent to iberiaand still less for your serfs f they arebeaten flogged or sent to iberia  dont suppose they are any theworse off n iberia they lead the same animal life and the stripes ontheir bodies heal and they are happy as before ut it is a good thingfor proprietors who perish morally bring remorse upon themselvesstifle this remorse and grow callous as a result of being able toinflict punishments justly and unjustly t is those people  pity andfor their sake  should like to liberate the serfs ou may not haveseen but  have seen how good men brought up in those traditions ofunlimited power in time when they grow more irritable become cruel andharsh are conscious of it but cannot restrain themselves and grow moreand more miserablerince ndrew spoke so earnestly that ierre could not help thinkingthat these thoughts had been suggested to rince ndrew by his fatherscasee did not replyo thats what m sorry forhuman dignity peace of mind purity andnot the serfs backs and foreheads which beat and shave as you mayalways remain the same backs and foreheadso no  thousand times no  shall never agree with you saidierre n the evening ndrew and ierre got into the open carriage and drove toald ills rince ndrew glancing at ierre broke the silence now andthen with remarks which showed that he was in a good temperointing to the fields he spoke of the improvements he was making inhis husbandryierre remained gloomily silent answering in monosyllables andapparently immersed in his own thoughtse was thinking that rince ndrew was unhappy had gone astray did notsee the true light and that he ierre ought to aid enlighten andraise him ut as soon as he thought of what he should say he felt thatrince ndrew with one word one argument would upset all his teachingand he shrank from beginning afraid of exposing to possible ridiculewhat to him was precious and sacredo but why do you think so ierre suddenly began lowering his headand looking like a bull about to charge why do you think so oushould not think sohink hat about asked rince ndrew with surprisebout life about mans destiny t cant be so  myself thought likethat and do you know what saved me reemasonry o dont smilereemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect as  thought it wasreemasonry is the best expression of the best the eternal aspects ofhumanitynd he began to explain reemasonry as he understood it to rincendrew e said that reemasonry is the teaching of hristianity freedfrom the bonds of tate and hurch a teaching of equality brotherhoodand lovenly our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life all the rest isa dream said ierre nderstand my dear fellow that outside thisunion all is filled with deceit and falsehood and  agree with you thatnothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out hislife like you merely trying not to harm others ut make ourfundamental convictions your own join our brotherhood give yourself upto us let yourself be guided and you will at once feel yourself as have felt myself a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning ofwhich is hidden in heaven said ierrerince ndrew looking straight in front of him listened in silence toierres words ore than once when the noise of the wheels preventedhis catching what ierre said he asked him to repeat it and by thepeculiar glow that came into rince ndrews eyes and by his silenceierre saw that his words were not in vain and that rince ndrew wouldnot interrupt him or laugh at what he saidhey reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had tocross by ferry hile the carriage and horses were being placed on itthey also stepped on the raftrince ndrew leaning his arms on the raft railing gazed silently atthe flooding waters glittering in the setting sunell what do you think about it ierre asked hy are you silenthat do

repeated but ierre giving him no timeto reply took the repetition for a denial the more readily as he knewrince ndrews former atheistic convictionsou say you cant see a reign of goodness and truth on earth or could and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end ofeverything n earth here on this earth ierre pointed to thefields there is no truth all is false and evil but in the

convince me dear friendlife and death are what convincehat convinces is when one sees a being dear to one bound up with onesown life before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it rightrince ndrews voice trembled and he turned away and suddenly thatbeing is seized with pain suffers and ceases to exist hy tcannot be that there is no answer nd  believe there is hatswhat convinces that is what has convinced me said rince ndrewes yes of course said ierre isnt that what m sayingo ll  say is that it is not argument that convinces me of thenecessity of a future life but this when you go hand in hand withsomeone and all at once that person vanishes there into nowhere andyou yourself are left facing that abyss and look in nd  have lookedinell thats it then ou know that there is a there and there is aomeone here is the future life he omeone isodrince ndrew did not reply he carriage and horses had long since beentaken off onto the farther bank and reharnessed he sun had sunk halfbelow the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near theferry but ierre and ndrew to the astonishment of the footmencoachmen and ferrymen still stood on the raft and talkedf there is a od and future life there is truth and good and manshighest happiness consists in striving to attain them e must live wemust love and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrapof earth but have lived and shall live forever there in the holesaid ierre and he pointed to the skyrince ndrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening toierre and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of thesun gleaming on the blue waters here was perfect stillness ierrebecame silent he raft had long since stopped and only the waves of thecurrent beat softly against it below rince ndrew felt as if the soundof the waves kept up a refrain to ierres words whisperingt is true believe ite sighed and glanced with a radiant childlike tender look atierres face flushed and rapturous but yet shy before his superiorfriendes if it only were so said rince ndrew owever it is time toget on he added and stepping off the raft he looked up at the skyto which ierre had pointed and for the first time since usterlitz sawthat high everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefieldand something that had long been slumbering something that was bestwithin him suddenly awoke joyful and youthful in his soul tvanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his lifebut he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to developexisted within him is meeting with

and ademoiselle ourienne looked at himwith pleasant smiles when he talked to the old princehe old prince came in to supper this was evidently on ierresaccount nd during the two days of the young mans visit he wasextremely kind to him and told him to visit them againhen ierre had gone and the members of the household met together theybegan to express their opinions of him as people always do after a newacquaintance has left but as seldom happens no one said anything butwhat was good of him hen returning from his leave ostov felt for the first time howclose was the bond that united him to enisov and the whole regimentn approaching it ostov felt as he had done when approaching his homein oscow hen he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform ofhis regiment when he recognized redhaired ementyev and saw the picketropes of the roan horses when avrushka gleefully shouted to hismaster he count has come and enisov who had been asleep on hisbed ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him and theofficers collected round to greet the new arrival ostov experiencedthe same feeling as when his mother his father and his sister hadembraced him and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speakhe regiment was also a home and as unalterably dear and precious ashis parents househen he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and hadbeen reassigned to his former squadron had been on duty and had goneout foraging when he had again entered into all the little interests ofthe regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in onenarrow unchanging frame he experienced the same sense of peace ofmoral support and the same sense of being at home here in his ownplace as he had felt under the parental roof ut here was none of allthat turmoil of the world at large where he did not know his rightplace and took mistaken decisions here was no onya with whom he oughtor ought not to have an explanation here was no possibility of goingthere or not going there here there were not twentyfour hours in theday which could be spent in such a variety of ways there was not thatinnumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or fartherfrom him than another there were none of those uncertain and undefinedmoney relations with his father and nothing to recall that terribleloss to olokhov ere in the regiment all was clear and simple hewhole world was divided into two unequal parts one our avlogradregiment the other all the rest nd the rest was no concern of hisn the regiment everything was definite who was lieutenant whocaptain who was a good fellow who a bad one and most of all who wasa comrade he canteenkeeper gave one credit ones pay came every fourmonths there was nothing to think out or decide you had only to donothing that was considered bad in the avlograd regiment and whengiven an order to do what was clearly distinctly and definitelyorderedand all would be wellaving once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimentallife ostov felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down torest ife in the regiment during this campaign was all the pleasanterfor him because after his loss to olokhov for which in spite of allhis familys efforts to console him he could not forgive himself hehad made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving not as he haddone before but really well and by being a perfectly firstratecomrade and officerin a word a splendid man altogether a thing whichseemed so difficult out in the world but so possible in the regimentfter his losses he had determined to pay back his debt to his parentsin five years e received ten thousand rubles a year but now resolvedto take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to hisparentsur army after repeated retreats and advances and battles at ultuskand reussischylau was concentrated near artenstein t was awaitingthe mperors arrival and the beginning of a new campaignhe avlograd regiment belonging to that part of the army which hadserved in the  campaign had been recruiting up to strength inussia and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of thecampaign t had been neither at ultusk nor at reussischylau andwhen it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaignwas attached to latovs divisionlatovs division was acting independently of the main army everaltimes parts of the avlograd regiment had exchanged shots with theenemy had taken prisoners and once had even captured arshal udinotscarriages n pril the avlograds were stationed immovably for someweeks near a totally ruined and deserted erman village thaw had set in it was muddy and cold the ice on the river brokeand the roads became impassable or days neither provisions for the mennor fodder for the horses had been issued s no transports couldarrive the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villagessearching for potatoes but found few even of theseverything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fledif anyremained they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be takenfrom them even the soldiers usually pitiless enough instead of takinganything from them often gave them the last of their rationshe avlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action but hadlost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness n the hospitalsdeath was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever or the swellingthat came from bad food preferred to remain on duty and hardly able todrag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals henspring came on the soldiers found a plant just showing out of theground that looked like asparagus which for some reason they calledashkas sweet root t was very bitter but they wandered about thefields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it thoughthey were ordered not to do so as it was a noxious plant hat spring anew disease broke out among the soldiers a swelling of the arms legsand face which the doctors attributed to eating this root ut in spiteof all this the soldiers of enisovs squadron fed chiefly on ashkassweet root because it was the second week that the last of thebiscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and thelast potatoes received had sprouted and frozenhe horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatchedroofs and had become terribly thin though still covered with tufts offelty winter hairespite this destitution the soldiers and officers went on living justas usual espite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms thehussars formed line for roll call kept things in order groomed theirhorses polished their arms brought in straw from the thatched roofs inplace of fodder and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which theyrose up hungry joking about their nasty food and their hunger susual in their spare time they lit bonfires steamed themselves beforethem naked smoked picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes toldand listened to stories of otemkins and uvorovs campaigns or tolegends of lesha the ly or the priests laborer ikolkahe officers as usual lived in twos and threes in the roofless halfruined houses he seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and ingeneral food for the men he younger ones occupied themselves asbefore some playing cards there was plenty of money though there wasno food some with more innocent games such as quoits and skittleshe general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of partly becausenothing certain was known about it partly because there was a vaguefeeling that in the main it was going badlyostov lived as before with enisov and since their furlough they hadbecome more friendly than ever enisov never spoke of ostovs familybut by the tender friendship his commander showed him ostov felt thatthe elder hussars luckless love for atasha played a part instrengthening their friendship enisov evidently tried to expose ostovto danger as seldom as possible and after an action greeted his safereturn with evident joy n one of his foraging expeditions in adeserted and ruined village to which he had come in search ofprovisions ostov found a family consisting of an old ole and hisdaughter with an infant in arms hey were half clad hungry too weakto get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance ostovbrought them to his quarters placed them in his own lodging and keptthem for some weeks while the old man was recovering ne of hiscomrades talking of women began chaffing ostov saying that he wasmore wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if heintroduced to them the pretty olish girl he had saved ostov took thejoke as an insult flared up and said such unpleasant things to theofficer that it was all enisov could do to prevent a duel hen theofficer had gone away enisov who did not himself know what ostovsrelations with the olish girl might be began to upbraid him for hisquickness of temper and ostov replieday what you like he is like a sister to me and  cant tell youhow it offended me because well for that reasonenisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the roomwithout looking at ostov as was his way at moments of deep feelingh what a mad bweed you ostovs are he muttered and ostov noticedtears in his eyes n pril the troops were enlivened by news of the mperors arrival butostov had no chance of being present at the review he held atartenstein as the avlograds were at the outposts far beyond thatplacehey were bivouacking enisov and ostov were living in an earth hutdug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf hehut was made in the following manner which had then come into vogue trench was dug three and a half feet wide four feet eight inches deepand eight feet long t one end of the trench steps were cut out andthese formed the entrance and vestibule he trench itself was the roomin which the lucky ones such as the squadron commander had a boardlying on piles at the end

as ostov had never yet seen him in enisovcould not speak and gasped for breath hen ostov asked what was thematter he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarsefeeble voicelarmed at

and regretfully showedthem a paper addressed to ajor enisov from the regimental commander inwhich inquiries were made about yesterdays occurrence he adjutanttold them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn that acourtmartial had been appointed and that in view of the severity withwhich marauding and insubordination were now regarded degradation tothe ranks would be the best that could be hoped forhe case as represented by the offended parties was that afterseizing the transports ajor enisov being drunk went to the chiefquartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief threatenedto strike him and on being led out had rushed into the office and giventwo officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm of one of themn answer to ostovs renewed questions enisov said laughing that hethought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it butthat it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not in the least fearany kind of trial and that if those scoundrels dared attack him hewould give them an answer that they would not easily forgetenisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter but ostov knew himtoo well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart hefeared a courtmartial and was worried over the affair which wasevidently taking a bad turn very day letters of inquiry and noticesfrom the court arrived and on the first of ay enisov was ordered tohand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before thestaff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariatoffice n the previous day latov reconnoitered with two ossackregiments and two squadrons of hussars enisov as was his wont rodeout in front of the outposts parading his courage  bullet fired by arench sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg erhaps atanother time enisov would not have left the regiment for so slight awound but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearingat the staff and went into hospital n une the battle of riedland was fought in which the avlograds didnot take part and after that an armistice was proclaimed ostov whofelt his friends absence very much having no news of him since he leftand feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of hisaffairs took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit enisovin hospitalhe hospital was in a small russian town that had been twice devastatedby ussian and rench troops ecause it was summer when it is sobeautiful out in the fields the little town presented a particularlydismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences its foul streetstattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering abouthe hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames andpanes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fencethat had been pulled to pieces everal bandaged soldiers with paleswollen faces were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in theyardirectly ostov entered the door he was enveloped by a smell ofputrefaction and hospital air n the stairs he met a ussian armydoctor smoking a cigar he doctor was followed by a ussian assistant cant tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying ome to akarlexeevich in the evening  shall be therehe assistant asked some further questionsh do the best you can snt it all the same he doctor noticedostov coming upstairshat do you want sir

doctor and asked the assistant toshow him the waynly dont blame me the doctor shouted up after himostov and the assistant went into the dark corridor he smell was sostrong there that ostov held his nose and had to pause and collect hisstrength before he could go on  door opened to the right and anemaciated sallow man on crutches barefoot and in underclothing limpedout and leaning against the doorpost looked with glittering enviouseyes at those who were passing lancing in at the door ostov saw thatthe sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoatsay  go in and lookhat is there to see said the assistantut just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go inostov entered the soldiers ward he foul air to which he had alreadybegun to get used in the corridor was still stronger here t was alittle different more pungent and one felt that this was where itoriginatedn the long room brightly lit up by the sun through the large windowsthe sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls andleaving a passage in the middle ost of them were unconscious and paidno attention to the newcomers hose who were conscious raisedthemselves or lifted their thin yellow faces and all looked intently atostov with the same expression of hope of relief reproach and envyof anothers health ostov went to the middle of the room and lookingthrough the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thingthere e stood still looking silently around e had not at allexpected such a sight ust before him almost across the middle of thepassage on the bare floor lay a sick man probably a ossack to judgeby the cut of his hair he man lay on his back his huge arms and legsoutstretched is face was purple his eyes were rolled back so thatonly the whites were seen and on his bare legs and arms which werestill red the veins stood out like cords e was knocking the back ofhis head against the floor hoarsely uttering some word which he keptrepeating ostov listened and made out the word t was drink drinka drink ostov glanced round looking for someone who would put thisman back in his place and bring him waterho looks after the sick here he asked the assistantust then a commissariat soldier a hospital orderly came in from thenext room marching stiffly and drew up in front of ostovood day your honor he shouted rolling his eyes at ostov andevidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authoritieset him to his place and give him some water said ostov pointing tothe ossackes your honor the soldier replied complacently and rolling hiseyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter but did notmoveo its impossible to do anything here thought ostov lowering hiseyes and he was going out but became aware of an intense look fixed onhim on his right and he turned lose to the corner on an overcoatsat an old unshaven graybearded soldier as thin as a skeleton with astern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on ostov he mans neighboron one side whispered something to him pointing at ostov who noticedthat the old man wanted to speak to him e drew nearer and saw that theold man had only one leg bent under him the other had been amputatedabove the knee is neighbor on the other side who lay motionless somedistance from him with his head thrown back was a young soldier with asnub nose is pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes wererolled back ostov looked at the young soldier and a cold chill randown his backhy this one seems he began turning to the assistantnd how weve been begging your honor said the old soldier his jawquivering es been dead since morning fter all were men notdogsll send someone at once e shall be taken awaytaken away at oncesaid the assistant hurriedly et us go your honores yes let us go said ostov hastily and lowering his eyes andshrinking he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachfulenvious eyes that were fixed upon him and went out of the room oing along the corridor the assistant led ostov to the officerswards consisting of three rooms the doors of which stood open herewere beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying orsitting on them ome were walking about the rooms in hospital dressinggowns he first person ostov met in the officers ward was a thinlittle man with one arm who was walking about the first room in anightcap and hospital dressing gown with a pipe between his teethostov looked at him trying to remember where he had seen him beforeee where weve met again said the little man ushin ushin dontyou remember who gave you a lift at chon rabern nd ve had a bitcut off you see he went on with a smile pointing to the emptysleeve of his dressing gown ooking for asili mitrich enisov yneighbor he added when he heard who ostov wanted ere here andushin led him into the next room from whence came sounds of severallaughing voicesow can they laugh or even live at all here thought ostov stillaware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in thesoldiers ward and still seeming to see fixed on him those enviouslooks which had followed him out from both sides and the face of thatyoung soldier with eyes rolled backenisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket though itwas nearly noonh ostov ow are you how are you he called out still in the samevoice as in the regiment but ostov noticed sadly that under thishabitual ease and animation some new sinister hidden feeling showeditself in the expression of enisovs face and the intonations of hisvoiceis wound though a slight one had not yet healed even now six weeksafter he had been hit is face had the same swollen pallor as the facesof the other hospital patients but it was not this that struck ostovhat struck him was that enisov did not seem glad to see him andsmiled at him unnaturally e did not ask about the regiment nor aboutthe general state of affairs and when ostov spoke of these matters didnot listenostov even noticed that enisov did not like to be reminded of theregiment or in general of that other free life which was going onoutside the hospital e seemed to try to forget that old life and wasonly interested in the affair with the commissariat officers nostovs inquiry as to how the matter stood he at once produced fromunder his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and therough draft of his answer to it e became animated when he beganreading his paper and specially drew ostovs attention to the stingingrejoinders he made to his enemies is hospital companions who hadgathered round ostova fresh arrival from the world outsidegraduallybegan to disperse as soon as enisov began reading his answer ostovnoticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard thatstory more than once and were tired of it nly the man who had the nextbed a stout hlan continued to sit on his bed gloomily frowning andsmoking a pipe and little onearmed ushin still listened shaking hishead disapprovingly n the middle of the reading the hlan interruptedenisovut what  say is he said turning to ostov it would be bestsimply to petition the mperor for pardon hey say great rewards willnow be distributed and surely a pardon would be grantede petition the mpewo exclaimed enisov in a voice to which hetried hard to give the old energy and fire but which sounded like anexpression of irritable impotence hat

ask this gentleman to take it o doubt heindicating ostov has connections on the staff ou wont find abetter opportunityavent  said m not going to gwovel enisov interrupted him wenton reading his paperostov had not the courage to persuade enisov though he instinctivelyfelt that the way advised by ushin and the other officers was thesafest and though he would have been glad to be of service to enisove knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temperhen the reading of enisovs virulent reply which took more than anhour was over ostov said nothing and he spent the rest of the day ina most dejected state of mind amid enisovs hospital comrades who hadgathered round him telling them what he knew and listening to theirstories enisov was moodily silent all the eveningate in the evening when ostov was about to leave he asked enisovwhether he had no commission for himes wait a bit said enisov glancing round at the officers andtaking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window where hehad an inkpot and sat down to writet seems its no use knocking ones head against a wall he saidcoming from the window and giving ostov a large envelope n it was thepetition to the mperor drawn up by the auditor in which enisovwithout alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials simplyasked for pardonand it in t seemse did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smile aving returned to the regiment and told the commander the state ofenisovs affairs ostov rode to ilsit with the letter to the mperorn the thirteenth of une the rench and ussian mperors arrived inilsit oris rubetskoy had asked the important personage on whom hewas in attendance to include him in the suite appointed for the stay atilsit should like to see the great man he said alluding to apoleonwhom hitherto he like everyone else had always called uonaparteou are speaking of uonaparte asked the general smilingoris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he wasbeing tested am speaking rince of the mperor apoleon he replied hegeneral patted him on the shoulder with a smileou will go far he said and took him to ilsit with himoris was among the few present at the iemen on the day the twomperors met e saw the raft decorated with monograms saw apoleonpass before the rench uards on the farther bank of the river saw thepensive face of the mperor lexander as he sat in silence in a tavernon the bank of the iemen awaiting apoleons arrival saw both mperorsget into boats and saw how apoleonreaching the raft firststeppedquickly forward to meet lexander and held out his hand to him and howthey both retired into the pavilion ince he had begun to move in thehighest circles oris had made it his habit to watch attentively allthat went on around him and to note it down t the time of the meetingat ilsit he asked the names of those who had come with apoleon andabout the uniforms they wore and listened attentively to words spokenby important personages t the moment the mperors went into thepavilion he looked at his watch and did not forget to look at it againwhen lexander came out he interview had lasted an hour and fiftythree minutes e noted this down that same evening among other factshe felt to be of historic importance s the mperors suite was a verysmall one it was a matter of great importance for a man who valued hissuccess in the service to be at ilsit on the occasion of thisinterview between the two mperors and having succeeded in this orisfelt that henceforth his position was fully assured e had not onlybecome known but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted himwice he had executed commissions to the mperor himself so that thelatter knew his face and all those at court far from coldshoulderinghim as at first when they considered him a newcomer would now have beensurprised had he been absentoris lodged with another adjutant the olish ount hilinskihilinski a ole brought up in aris was rich and passionately fondof the rench and almost every day of the stay at ilsit renchofficers of the uard and from rench headquarters were dining andlunching with him and orisn the evening of the twentyfourth of une ount hilinski arranged asupper for his rench friends he guest of honor was an aidedecamp ofapoleons there were also several rench officers of the uard and apage of apoleons a young lad of an old aristocratic rench familyhat same day ostov profiting by the darkness to avoid beingrecognized in civilian dress came to ilsit and went to the lodgingoccupied by oris and hilinskiostov in common with the whole army from which he came was far fromhaving experienced the change of feeling toward apoleon and the renchwho from being foes had suddenly become friendsthat had taken placeat headquarters and in oris n the army onaparte and the rench werestill regarded with mingled feelings of anger contempt and fear nlyrecently talking with one of latovs ossack officers ostov hadargued that if apoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as asovereign but as a criminal uite lately happening to meet a woundedrench colonel on the road ostov had maintained with heat that peacewas impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminalonaparte ostov was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence ofrench officers in oris lodging dressed in uniforms he had beenaccustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outpostsof the flank s soon as he noticed a rench officer who thrust hishead out of the door that warlike feeling of hostility which he alwaysexperienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him e stopped atthe threshold and asked in ussian whether rubetskoy lived thereoris hearing a strange voice in the anteroom came out to meet him nexpression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face on firstrecognizing ostovh its you ery glad very glad to see you he said howevercoming toward him with a smile ut ostov had noticed his firstimpulseve come at a bad time  think  should not have come but  havebusiness he said coldlyo  only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment ansun moment je suis a vous  he said answering someone who called him n a minute  shall be at your disposal see m intruding ostov repeatedhe look of annoyance had already disappeared from oris face havingevidently reflected and decided how to act he very quietly took bothostovs hands and led him into the next room is eyes lookingserenely and steadily at ostov seemed to be veiled by something as ifscreened by blue spectacles of conventionality o it seemed to ostovh come now s if you could come at a wrong time said oris and heled him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced himto his guests explaining that he was not a civilian but an hussarofficer and an old friend of hisount hilinskile omte  le apitaine   said he naminghis guests ostov looked frowningly at the renchmen bowedreluctantly and remained silenthilinski evidently did not receive this new ussian person verywillingly into his circle and did not speak to ostov oris did notappear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and with the samepleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which hehad met ostov tried to enliven the conversation ne of the renchmenwith the politeness characteristic of his countrymen addressed theobstinately taciturn ostov saying that the latter had probably come toilsit to see the mperoro  came on business replied ostov brieflyostov had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look ofdissatisfaction on oris face and as always happens to those in a badhumor it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion andthat he was in everybodys way e really was in their way for he alonetook no part in the conversation which again became general he looksthe visitors cast on him seemed to say nd what is he sitting herefor e rose and went up to orisnyhow m in your way he said in a low tone ome and talk over mybusiness and ll go awayh no not at all said oris ut if you are tired come and liedown in my room and have a restes reallyhey went into the little room where oris slept ostov withoutsitting down began at once irritably as if oris were to blame insome way telling him about enisovs affair asking him whetherthrough his general he could and would intercede with the mperor onenisovs behalf and get enisovs petition handed in hen he and oriswere alone ostov felt for the first time that he could not look orisin the face without a sense of awkwardness oris with one leg crossedover the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers ofhis right listened to ostov as a general listens to the report of asubordinate now looking aside and now gazing straight into ostovseyes with the same veiled look ach time this happened ostov feltuncomfortable and cast down his eyes have heard of such cases and know that is ajesty is very severe insuch affairs  think it would be best not to bring it before themperor but to apply to the commander of the corps ut in general thinko you dont want to do anything ell then say so ostov almostshouted not looking oris in the faceoris smiledn the contrary  will do what  can nly  thoughtt that moment hilinskis voice was heard calling orisell then go go go said ostov and refusing supper andremaining alone in the little room he walked up and down for a longtime hearing the lighthearted rench conversation from the next room ostov had come to ilsit the day least suitable for a petition onenisovs behalf e could not himself go to the general in attendanceas he was in mufti and had come to ilsit without permission to do soand oris even had he wished to could not have done so on thefollowing day n that day une  the preliminaries of peace weresigned he mperors exchanged decorations lexander received the rossof the egion of onor and apoleon the rder of t ndrew of the irstegree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by abattalion of the rench uards to the reobrazhensk battalion hemperors were to be present at that banquetostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with oris that when thelatter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early nextmorning went away avoiding oris n his civilian clothes and a roundhat he wandered about the town staring at the rench and theiruniforms and at the streets and houses where the ussian and renchmperors were staying n a square he saw tables being set up andpreparations made for the dinner he saw the ussian and rench colorsdraped from side to side of the streets with huge monograms  and  nthe windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayedoris doesnt want to help me and  dont want to ask him hatssettled thought icholas ll is over between us but  wont leavehere without having done all  can for enisov and certainly not withoutgetting his letter to the mperor he mperor e is here thoughtostov who had unconsciously returned to the house where lexanderlodgedaddled horses were standing before the house and the suite wereassembling evidently preparing for the mperor to come out may see him at any moment thought ostov f only  were to handthe letter direct to him and tell him all could they really arrest mefor my civilian clothes urely not e would understand on whose sidejustice lies e understands everything knows everything ho can bemore just more magnanimous than he nd even if they did arrest me forbeing here what would it matter thought he looking at an officer whowas entering the house the mperor occupied fter all people do goin ts all nonsense ll go in and hand the letter to the mperormyself so much the worse for rubetskoy who drives me to it ndsuddenly with a determination he himself did not expect ostov felt forthe letter in his pocket and went straight to the houseo  wont miss my opportunity now as  did after usterlitz hethought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious ofthe blood that rushed to his heart at the thought  will fall at hisfeet and beseech him e will lift me up will listen and will eventhank me  am happy when  can do good but to remedy injustice is thegreatest happiness ostov fancied the sovereign saying nd passingpeople who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch of themperors house broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right hesaw a closed door elow under the staircase was a door leading to thelower floorhom do you want someone inquiredo hand in a letter a petition to is ajesty said icholas with atremor in his voice petition his way to the officer on duty he was shown the doorleading downstairs only it wont be acceptedn hearing this indifferent voice ostov grew frightened at what he wasdoing the thought of meeting the mperor at any moment was sofascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run awaybut the official who had questioned him opened the door and ostoventered short stout man of about thirty in white breeches and high boots anda batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on standing in thatroom and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a newpair of handsome silkembroidered braces that for some reasonattracted ostovs attention his man was speaking to someone in theadjoining room good figure and in her first bloom he was saying but on seeingostov he stopped short and frownedhat is it  petitionhat is it asked the person in the other roomnother petitioner answered the man with the bracesell him to come later ell be coming out directly we must goater later omorrow ts too lateostov turned and was about to go but the man in the braces stoppedhimhom have you come from ho are you come from ajor enisov answered ostovre you an officerieutenant ount ostovhat audacity and it in through your commander nd go along withyou go and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed himostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there weremany officers and generals in full parade uniform whom he had to passursing his temerity his heart sinking at the thought of findinghimself at any moment face to face with the mperor and being put toshame and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the improprietyof his conduct and repenting of it ostov with downcast eyes wasmaking his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when afamiliar voice called him and a hand detained himhat are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep voicet was a cavalry general who had obtained the mperors special favorduring this campaign and who had formerly commanded the division inwhich ostov was servingostov in dismay began justifying himself but seeing the kindlyjocular face of the general he took him aside and in an excited voicetold him the whole affair asking him to intercede for enisov whom thegeneral knew aving heard ostov to the end the general shook his headgravelym sorry sorry for that fine fellow ive me the letterardly had ostov handed him the letter and finished explainingenisovs case when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard onthe stairs and the general leaving him went to the porch hegentlemen of the mperors suite ran down the stairs and went to theirhorses ayne the same groom who had been at usterlitz led up themperors horse and the faint creak of a footstep ostov knew at

wishing to quarreles and to drink assented icholas ullo there nother bottlehe shoutedn  the mperor lexander went to rfurt for a fresh interview withthe mperor apoleon and in the upper circles of etersburg there wasmuch talk of the grandeur of this important meeting n  the intimacy between the worlds two arbiters as apoleon andlexander were called was such that when apoleon declared war onustria a ussian corps crossed the frontier to cooperate with our oldenemy onaparte against our old ally the mperor of ustria and incourt circles the possibility of marriage between apoleon and one oflexanders sisters was spoken of ut besides considerations of foreignpolicy the attention of ussian society was at that time keenlydirected on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all thedepartments of governmentife meanwhilereal life with its essential interests of health andsickness toil and rest and its intellectual interests in thoughtscience poetry music love friendship hatred and passionswent onas usual independently of and apart from political friendship or enmitywith apoleon onaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction     rince ndrew had spent two years continuously in the countryll the plans ierre had attempted on his estatesand constantlychanging from one thing to another had never accomplishedwere carriedout by rince ndrew without display and without perceptible difficultye had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which ierre lackedand without fuss or strain on his part this set things goingn one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and becamefree agricultural laborersthis being one of the first examples of thekind in ussia n other estates the serfs compulsory labor wascommuted for a quitrent  trained midwife was engaged for ogucharovoat his expense and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing tothe children of the peasants and household serfsrince ndrew spent half his time at ald ills with his father and hisson who was still in the care of nurses he other half he spent inogucharovo loister as his father called rince ndrews estateespite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed toierre he diligently followed all that went on received many booksand to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors frometersburg the very vortex of life these people lagged behind himselfwho never left the countryin knowledge of what was happening in homeand foreign affairsesides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety ofbooks rince ndrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of ourlast two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing up a proposal for areform of the army rules and regulationsn the spring of  he went to visit the yazan estates which had beeninherited by his son whose guardian he wasarmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the newgrass the first leaves on the birches and the first puffs of whitespring clouds floating across the clear blue sky e was not thinking ofanything but looked absentmindedly and cheerfully from side to sidehey crossed the ferry where he had talked with ierre the year beforehey went through the muddy village past threshing floors and greenfields of winter rye downhill where snow still lodged near the bridgeuphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain past strips ofstubble land and bushes touched with green here and there and into abirch forest growing on both sides of the road n the forest it wasalmost hot no wind could be felt he birches with their sticky greenleaves were motionless and lilaccolored flowers and the first bladesof green grass were pushing up and lifting last years leaves hecoarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and thereamong the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter n entering theforest the horses began to snort and sweated visiblyeter the footman made some remark to the coachman the latter assentedut apparently the coachmans sympathy was not enough for eter and heturned on the box toward his masterow pleasant it is your excellency he said with a respectful smilehatts pleasant your excellencyhat is he talking about thought rince ndrew h the spring suppose he thought as he turned round es really everything isgreen already ow early he birches and cherry and alders too arecoming out ut the oaks show no sign yet h here is one oakt the edge of the road stood an oak robably ten times the age of thebirches that formed the forest it was ten times as thick and twice astall as they t was an enormous tree its girth twice as great as a mancould embrace and evidently long ago some of its branches had beenbroken off and its bark scarred ith its huge ungainly limbs sprawlingunsymmetrically and its gnarled hands and fingers it stood an agedstern and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees nly thedeadlooking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest and this oakrefused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring orthe sunshinepring love happiness this oak seemed to say re you not weary ofthat stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud lways the same andalways a fraud here is no spring no sun no happiness ook at thosecramped dead firs ever the same and at me too sticking out my brokenand barked fingers just where they have grown whether from my back ormy sides as they have grown so  stand and  do not believe in yourhopes and your liess he passed through the forest rince ndrew turned several times tolook at that oak as if expecting something from it nder the oak toowere flowers and grass but it stood among them scowling rigidmisshapen and grim as everes the oak is right a thousand times right thought rince ndrewet othersthe youngyield afresh to that fraud but we know lifeour life is finished whole sequence of new thoughts hopeless but mournfully pleasant rosein his soul in connection with that tree uring this journey he as itwere considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusionrestful in its hopelessness that it was not for him to begin anythinganewbut that he must live out his life content to do no harm and notdisturbing himself or desiring anything rince ndrew had to see the arshal of the obility for the district inconnection with the affairs of the yazan estate of which he wastrustee his arshal was ount lya ostov and in the middle of ayrince ndrew went to visit himt was now hot spring weather he whole forest was already clothed ingreen t was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed tobatherince ndrew depressed and preoccupied with the business about whichhe had to speak to the arshal was driving up the avenue in the groundsof the ostovs house at tradnoe e heard merry girlish cries behindsome trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross thepath of his caleche head of the rest and nearer to him ran a darkhaired remarkably slim pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress with awhite handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hairescaped he girl was shouting something but seeing that he was astranger ran back laughing without looking at himuddenly he did not know why he felt a pang he day was so beautifulthe sun so bright everything around so gay but that slim pretty girldid not know or wish to know of his existence and was contented andcheerful in her own separateprobably foolishbut bright and happylife hat is she so glad about hat is she thinking of ot of themilitary regulations or of the arrangement of the yazan serfsquitrents f what is she thinking hy is she so happy rince ndrewasked himself with instinctive curiosityn  ount lya ostov was living at tradnoe just as he had done informer years that is entertaining almost the whole province withhunts theatricals dinners and music e was glad to see rincendrew as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his stayingthe nighturing the dull day in the course of which he was entertained by hiselderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old countshouse was crowded on account of an approaching name day rince ndrewrepeatedly glanced at atasha gay and laughing among the youngermembers of the company and asked himself each time hat is shethinking about hy is she so gladhat night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to sleep eread awhile and then put out his candle but relit it t was hot in theroom the inside shutters of which were closed e was cross with thestupid old man as he called ostov who had made him stay by assuringhim that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town and hewas vexed with himself for having stayede got up and went to the window to open it s soon as he opened theshutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for this burstinto the room e opened the casement he night was fresh bright andvery still ust before the window was a row of pollard trees lookingblack on one side and with a silvery light on the other eneath thetrees grew some kind of lush wet bushy vegetation with silverlitleaves and stems here and there arther back beyond the dark trees aroof glittered with dew to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantlywhite trunk and branches and above it shone the moon nearly at itsfull in a pale almost starless spring sky rince ndrew leaned hiselbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that skyis room was on the first floor hose in the rooms above were alsoawake e heard female voices overheadust once more said a girlish voice above him which rince ndrewrecognized at onceut when are you coming to bed replied another voice wont  cant sleep whats the use ome now for the last timewo girlish voices sang a musical passagethe end of some songh how lovely ow go to sleep and theres an end of itou go to sleep but  cant said the first voice coming nearer tothe window he was evidently leaning right out for the rustle of herdress and even her breathing could be heard verything was stonestilllike the moon and its light and the shadows rince ndrew too darednot stir for fear of betraying his unintentional presenceonya onya he again heard the first speaker h how can yousleep nly look how glorious it is h how glorious o wake uponya she said almost with tears in her voice here never never wassuch a lovely night beforeonya made some reluctant replyo just come and see what a moon h how lovely ome herearling sweetheart come here here you see  feel like sitting downon my heels putting my arms round my knees like this straining tightas tight as possible and flying away ike thisake care youll fall oute heard the sound of a scuffle and onyas disapproving voice tspast one oclockh you only spoil things for me ll right go gogain all was silent but rince ndrew knew she was still sittingthere rom time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh od  od hat does it mean she suddenly exclaimed o bed thenif it must be and she slammed the casementor her  might as well not exist thought rince ndrew while helistened to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that shemight say something about him here she is again s if it were onpurpose thought hen his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthfulthoughts and hopes contrary to the whole tenor of his life that unableto explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once ext morning having taken leave of no one but the count and notwaiting for the ladies to appear rince ndrew set off for homet was already the beginning of une when on his return journey he droveinto the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange andmemorable an impression on him n the forest the harness bells soundedyet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for now all wasthick shady and dense and the young firs dotted about in the forestdid not jar on the general beauty but lending themselves to the moodaround were delicately green with fluffy young shootshe whole day had been hot omewhere a storm was gathering but only asmall cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the roadand the sappy leaves he left side of the forest was dark in the shadethe right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcelyswayed by the breeze verything was in blossom the nightingalestrilled and their voices reverberated now near now far awayes here in this forest was that oak with which  agreed thoughtrince ndrew ut where is it he again wondered gazing at the leftside of the road and without recognizing it he looked with admirationat the very oak he sought he old oak quite transfigured spreadingout a canopy of sappy darkgreen foliage stood rapt and slightlytrembling in the rays of the evening sun either gnarled fingers norold scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence nowhrough the hard centuryold bark even where there were no twigsleaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veterancould have producedes it is the same oak thought rince ndrew and all at once he wasseized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal ll thebest moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory usterlitz withthe lofty heavens his wifes dead reproachful face ierre at theferry that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night and that nightitself and the moon and all this rushed suddenly to his mindo life is not over at thirtyone rince ndrew suddenly decidedfinally and decisively t is not enough for me to know what  have inmeeveryone must know it ierre and that young girl who wanted to flyaway into the sky everyone must know me so that my life may not belived for myself alone while others live so apart from it but so thatit may be reflected in them all and they and  may live in harmonyn reaching home rince ndrew decided to go to etersburg that autumnand found all sorts of reasons for this decision  whole series ofsensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for himto go to etersburg and even to reenter the service kept springing upin his mind e could not now understand how he could ever even havedoubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as a monthbefore he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet countrycould ever enter his head t now seemed clear to him that all hisexperience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it tosome kind of work and again played an active part in life e did noteven remember how formerly on the strength of similar wretched logicalarguments it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself ifhe now after the lessons he had had in life allowed himself to believein the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happinessor love ow reason suggested quite the opposite fter that journey toyazan he found the country dull his former pursuits no longerinterested him and often when sitting alone in his study he got upwent to the mirror and gazed a long time at his own face hen he wouldturn away to the portrait of his dead ise who with hair curled a lagrecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame he didnot now say those former terrible words to him but looked simplymerrily and inquisitively at him nd rince ndrew crossing his armsbehind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling as hereflected on those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as acrime which altered his whole life and were connected with ierre withfame with the girl at the window the oak and womans beauty and lovend if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularlycold stern and above all unpleasantly logicaly dear rincess ary entering at such a moment would say littleicholas cant go out today its very coldf it were hot rince ndrew would reply at such times very dryly tohis sister he could go out in his smock but as it is cold he mustwear warm clothes which were designed for that purpose hat is whatfollows from the fact that it is cold and not that a child who needsfresh air should remain at home he would add with extreme logic as ifpunishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirredwithin himt such moments rincess ary would think how intellectual work driesmen up rince ndrew arrived in etersburg in ugust  t was the timewhen the youthful peranski was at the zenith of his fame and hisreforms

rince ndrew as agentleman of the chamber presented himself at court and at a levee hemperor though he met him twice did not favor him with a single wordt had always seemed to rince ndrew before that he was antipathetic tothe mperor and that the latter disliked his face and personalitygenerally and in the cold repellent glance the mperor gave him henow found further confirmation of this surmise he courtiers explainedthe mperors neglect of him by is ajestys displeasure at olkonskisnot having served since  know myself that one cannot help ones sympathies and antipathiesthought rince ndrew so it will not do to present my proposal for thereform of the army regulations to the mperor personally but theproject will speak for itselfe mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal a friend

theanterooms of many important men and the different types of such roomswere well known to him ount rakcheevs anteroom had quite a specialcharacter he faces of the unimportant people awaiting their

in referenceto ount rakcheev ne general an important personage evidentlyfeeling offended at having to wait so long sat crossing and uncrossinghis legs and smiling contemptuously to himselfut the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all facesthat of fear rince ndrew for the second time asked the adjutant onduty to take in his name but received an ironical look and was toldthat his turn would come in due course fter some others had been shownin and out of the ministers room by the adjutant on duty an officerwho struck rince ndrew by his humiliated and frightened air

andtrembling lipscame out and passed through the waiting room clutchinghis headfter this rince ndrew was conducted to the door and the officer onduty said in a whisper o the right at the windowrince ndrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man offorty with a long waist a long closely cropped head deep wrinklesscowling brows above dull greenishhazel eyes and an overhanging rednose

to rincendrew hile waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committeerince ndrew looked up his former acquaintances particularly those heknew to be in power and whose aid he might need n etersburg he nowexperienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle whentroubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the rulingcircles where the future on which the fate of millions depended wasbeing shaped rom the irritation of the older men the curiosity of theuninitiated the reserve of the initiated the hurry and preoccupationof everyone and the innumerable committees

know but who wassupposed to be a man of geniusperanski nd this movement ofreconstruction of which rince ndrew had a vague idea and peranskiits chief promoter began to interest him so keenly that the question ofthe army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in hisconsciousnessrince ndrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in thehighest and most diverse etersburg circles of the day he reformingparty cordially welcomed and courted him in the first place because hewas reputed to be clever and very well read and secondly because byliberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberalhe party of the old and dissatisfied who censured the innovationsturned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of thereforms simply because he was the son of his father he femininesociety world welcomed him gladly because he was rich distinguished agood match and almost a newcomer with a halo of romance on account ofhis supposed death and the tragic loss

the society in whichrince ndrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkwardand clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and selfassurance he hadnever seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those halfclosed rather humid eyes or so firm a smile that expressed nothingnor had he heard such a refined smooth soft voice above all he hadnever seen such delicate whiteness of face or handshands which werebroad but very plump soft and white uch whiteness and softnessrince ndrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been longin hospital his was peranski ecretary of tate reporter to themperor and his companion at rfurt where he had more than once met andtalked with apoleonperanski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as peopleinvoluntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry tospeak e spoke slowly with assurance that he would be listened to andhe looked only at the person with whom he was conversingrince ndrew followed peranskis every word and movement withparticular attention s happens to some people especially to men whojudge those near to them severely he always on meeting anyone newespecially anyone whom like peranski he knew by reputationexpectedto discover in him the perfection of human qualitiesperanski told ochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come sooneras he had been detained at the palace e did not say that the mperorhad kept him and rince ndrew noticed this affectation of modestyhen ochubey introduced rince ndrew peranski slowly turned his eyesto olkonski with his customary smile and looked at him in silence am very glad to make your acquaintance  had heard of you aseveryone has he said after a pauseochubey said a few words about the reception rakcheev had givenolkonski peranski smiled more markedlyhe chairman of the ommittee on rmy egulations is my good friendonsieur agnitski he said fully articulating every word andsyllable and if you like  can put you in touch with him e pausedat the full stop  hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to cooperate in promoting all that is reasonable circle soon formed round peranski and the old man who had talkedabout his subordinate ryanichnikov addressed a question to himrince ndrew without joining in the conversation watched every movementof peranskis this man not long since an insignificant divinitystudent who now olkonski thought held in his handsthose plumpwhite handsthe fate of ussia rince ndrew was struck by theextraordinarily disdainful composure with which peranski answered theold man e appeared to address condescending words to him from animmeasurable height hen the old man began to speak too loud peranskismiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage ofwhat pleased the sovereignaving talked for a little while in the general circle peranski roseand coming up to rince ndrew took him along to the other end of theroom t was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself inolkonski had no chance to talk with you rince during the animatedconversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me he saidwith a mildly contemptuous smile as if intimating by that smile that heand rince ndrew understood the insignificance of the people with whomhe had just been talking his flattered rince ndrew  have known ofyou for a long time first from your action with regard to your serfs afirst example of which it is very desirable that there should be moreimitators and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of thechamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decreeconcerning the ranks allotted to courtiers which is causing so muchgossip and tittletattleo said rince ndrew my father did not wish me to take advantageof the privilege  began the service from the lower gradeour father a man of the last century evidently stands above ourcontemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely reestablishesnatural justice think however that these condemnations have some ground returnedrince ndrew trying to resist peranskis influence of which he beganto be conscious e did not like to agree with him in everything andfelt a wish to contradict hough he usually spoke easily and well hefelt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking withperanski e was too much absorbed in observing the famous manspersonalityrounds of personal ambition maybe peranski put in quietlynd of state interest to some extent said rince ndrewhat do you mean asked peranski quietly lowering his eyes am an admirer of ontesquieu replied rince ndrew and his ideathat le principe des monarchies est lhonneur me parait incontestableertains droits et privileges de la noblesse me paraissent etre desmoyens de soutenir ce sentiment  he principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestableertain rights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a meansof maintaining that sentimenthe smile vanished from peranskis white face which was much improvedby the change robably rince ndrews thought interested himi vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue  he beganpronouncing rench with evident difficulty and speaking even slowerthan in ussian but quite calmly f you regard the question from that point of viewperanski went on to say that honor lhonneur cannot be upheld byprivileges harmful to the service that honor lhonneur is either anegative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source ofemulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards which recognize itis arguments were concise simple and clearn institution upholding honor the source of emulation is one similarto the egion dhonneur of the great mperor apoleon not harmful buthelpful to the success of the service but not a class or courtprivilege do not dispute that but it cannot be denied that court privilegeshave attained the same end returned rince ndrew very courtierconsiders himself bound to maintain his position worthilyet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege rince saidperanski indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably anargument which was embarrassing for his companion f you will do methe honor of calling on me on ednesday he added  will aftertalking with agnitski let you know what may interest you and shallalso have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with youlosing his eyes he bowed a la francaise without taking leave andtrying to attract as little attention as possible he left the room uring the first weeks of his stay in etersburg rince ndrew felt thewhole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quiteovershadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that cityn returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook fouror five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours he mechanismof life the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhereabsorbed the greater part of his vital energy e did nothing did noteven think or find time to think but only talked and talkedsuccessfully of what he had thought while in the countrye sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the sameremark on the same day in different circles ut he was so busy forwhole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinkingof nothings he had done on their first meeting at ochubeys peranski produceda strong impression on rince ndrew on the ednesday when he receivedhim ttette at his own house and talked to him long andconfidentiallyo olkonski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificantcreatures and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of thatperfection toward which he strove that he readily believed that inperanski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuousman ad peranski sprung from the same class as himself and possessedthe same breeding and traditions olkonski would soon have discoveredhis weak human unheroic sides but as it was peranskis strange andlogical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because hedid not quite understand him oreover peranski either because heappreciated the others capacity or because he considered it necessaryto win him to his side showed off his dispassionate calm reasonablenessbefore rince ndrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery whichgoes hand in hand with selfassurance and consists in a tacit assumptionthat ones companion is the only man besides oneself capable ofunderstanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonablenessand profundity of ones own ideasuring their long conversation on ednesday evening peranski more thanonce remarked e regard everything that is above the common level ofrooted custom or with a smile ut we want the wolves to be fedand the sheep to be safe or hey cannot understand this andall in a way that seemed to say e you and  understand what theyare and who we arehis first long conversation with peranski only strengthened in rincendrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meetinge saw in him a remarkable clearthinking man of vast intellect who byhis energy and persistence had attained power which he was using solelyfor the welfare of ussia n rince ndrews eyes peranski was the manhe would himself have wished to beone who explained all the facts oflife reasonably considered important only what was rational and wascapable of applying the standard of reason to everything verythingseemed so simple and clear in peranskis exposition that rince ndrewinvoluntarily agreed with him about everything f he replied andargued it was only because he wished to maintain his independence andnot submit to peranskis opinions entirely verything was right andeverything was as it should be only one thing disconcerted rincendrew his was peranskis cold mirrorlike look which did not allowone to penetrate to his soul and his delicate white hands which rincendrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those whopossess power his mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands irritatedrince ndrew he knew not why e was unpleasantly struck too by theexcessive contempt for others that he observed in peranski and by thediversity of lines of argument he used to support his opinions e madeuse of every kind of mental device except analogy and passed tooboldly it seemed to rince ndrew from one to another ow he wouldtake up the position of a practical man and condemn dreamers now thatof a satirist and laugh ironically at his opponents now grow severelylogical or suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics his lastresource was one he very frequently employed e would transfer aquestion to metaphysical heights pass on to definitions of space timeand thought and having deduced the refutation he needed would againdescend to the level of the original discussionn general the trait of peranskis mentality which struck rince ndrewmost was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authorityof reason t was evident that the thought could never occur to himwhich to rince ndrew seemed so natural namely that it is after allimpossible to express all one thinks and that he had never felt thedoubt s not all  think and believe nonsense nd it was just thispeculiarity of peranskis mind that particularly attracted rincendrewuring the first period of their acquaintance olkonski felt apassionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt foronaparte he fact that peranski was the son of a village priest andthat stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his humbleorigin as in fact many did caused rince ndrew to cherish hissentiment for him the more and unconsciously to strengthen itn that first evening olkonski spent with him having mentioned theommission for the evision of the ode of aws peranski told himsarcastically that the ommission had existed for a hundred and fiftyyears had cost millions and had done nothing except that osenkampfhad stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codesnd that is all the state has for the millions it has spent said hee want to give the enate new juridical powers but we have no lawshat is why it is a sin for men like you rince not to serve in thesetimesrince ndrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence wasneeded which he did not possessut nobody possesses it so what would you have t is a vicious circlefrom which we must break a way out week later rince ndrew was a member of the ommittee on rmyegulations andwhat he had not at all expectedwas chairman of asection of the committee for the revision of the laws t peranskisrequest he took the first part of the ivil ode that was being drawn upand with the aid of the ode apoleon and the nstitutes of ustinianhe worked at formulating the section on ersonal ights early two years before this in  ierre on returning to etersburgafter visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leadingposition among the etersburg reemasons e arranged dining and funerallodge meetings enrolled new members and busied himself uniting variouslodges and acquiring authentic charters e gave money for the erectionof temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of almsin regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular esupported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded inetersburgis life meanwhile continued as before with the same infatuations anddissipations e liked to dine and drink well and though he consideredit immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of thebachelor circles in which he movedmid the turmoil of his activities and distractions however ierre atthe end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to restupon it the more masonic ground on which he stood gave way under himt the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him thecloser bound he involuntarily became to the order hen he had joinedthe reemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidentlysteps onto the smooth surface of a bog hen he put his foot down itsank in o make quite sure of the firmness of the ground he put hisother foot down and sank deeper still became stuck in it andinvoluntarily waded kneedeep in the bogoseph lexeevich was not in etersburghe had of late stood aside fromthe affairs of the etersburg lodges and lived almost entirely inoscow ll the members of the lodges were men ierre knew in ordinarylife and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as rothers inreemasonry and not as rince  or van asilevich  whom he knew insociety mostly as weak and insignificant men nder the masonic apronsand insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed inordinary life ften after collecting alms and reckoning up twenty tothirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a dozenmembers of whom half were as well able to pay as himself ierreremembered the masonic vow in which each rother promised to devote allhis belongings to his neighbor and doubts on which he tried not todwell arose in his soule divided the rothers he knew into four categories n the first heput those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodgesor in human affairs but were exclusively occupied with the mysticalscience of the order with questions of the threefold designation ofod the three primordial elementssulphur mercury and saltor themeaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple ofolomon ierre respected this class of rothers to which the elder oneschiefly belonged including ierre thought oseph lexeevich himselfbut he did not share their interests is heart was not in the mysticalaspect of reemasonryn the second category ierre reckoned himself and others like himseeking and vacillating who had not yet found in reemasonry a straightand comprehensible path but hoped to do son the third category he included those rothers the majority who sawnothing in reemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies and prizedthe strict performance of these forms without troubling about theirpurport or significance uch were illarski and even the rand asterof the principal lodgeinally to the fourth category also a great many rothers belongedparticularly those who had lately joined hese according to ierresobservations were men who had no belief in anything nor desire foranything but joined the reemasons merely to associate with the wealthyyoung rothers who were influential through their connections or rankand of whom there were very many in the lodgeierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing reemasonryat any rate as he saw it here sometimes seemed to him based merely onexternals e did not think of doubting reemasonry itself butsuspected that ussian asonry had taken a wrong path and deviated fromits original principles nd so toward the end of the year he wentabroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the ordern the summer of  ierre returned to etersburg ur reemasons knewfrom correspondence with those abroad that ezukhov had obtained theconfidence of many highly placed persons had been initiated into manymysteries had been raised to a higher grade and was bringing back withhim much that might conduce to the advantage of the masonic cause inussia he etersburg reemasons all came to see him tried toingratiate themselves with him and it seemed to them all that he waspreparing something for them and concealing it solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened atwhich ierre promised to communicate to the etersburg rothers what hehad to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order hemeeting was a full one fter the usual ceremonies ierre rose and beganhis addressear rothers he began blushing and stammering with a writtenspeech in his hand it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries inthe seclusion of our lodgewe must actact e are drowsing but wemust act ierre raised his notebook and began to reador the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph ofvirtue he read we must cleanse men from prejudice diffuseprinciples in harmony with the spirit of the times undertake theeducation of the young unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with thewisest men boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions infidelity andfolly and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unityof purpose and possessed of authority and powero attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over viceand must endeavor to secure that the honest man may even in this worldreceive a lasting reward for his virtue ut in these great endeavors weare gravely hampered by the political institutions of today hat is tobe done in these circumstances o favor revolutions overthroweverything repel force by force o e are very far from thatvery violent reform deserves censure for it quite fails to remedy evilwhile men remain what they are and also because wisdom needs noviolencehe whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparingmen of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of convictionaimingat the punishment of vice and folly and patronizing talent and virtueraising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our rotherhoodnly then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the handsof the protectors of disorder and to control them without their beingaware of it n a word we must found a form of government holdinguniversal sway which should be diffused over the whole world withoutdestroying the bonds of citizenship and beside which all othergovernments can continue in their customary course and do everythingexcept what impedes the great aim of our order which is to obtain forvirtue the victory over vice his aim was that of hristianity itselft taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to followthe example and instruction of the best and wisest ment that time when everything was plunged in darkness preaching alonewas of course sufficient he novelty of ruth endowed her with specialstrength but now we need much more powerful methods t is nownecessary that man governed by his senses should find in virtue acharm palpable to those senses t is impossible to eradicate thepassions but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim and it istherefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passionswithin the limits of virtue ur order should provide means to that ends soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state eachof them again training two others and all being closely unitedeverything will be possible for our order which has already in secretaccomplished much for the welfare of mankindhis speech not only made a strong impression but created excitement inthe lodge he majority of the rothers seeing in it dangerous designsof lluminism  met it with a coldness that surprised ierre he randaster began answering him and ierre began developing his views withmore and more warmth t was long since there had been so stormy ameeting arties were formed some accusing ierre of lluminism otherssupporting him t that meeting he was struck for the first time by theendless variety of mens minds which prevents a truth from everpresenting itself identically to two persons ven those members whoseemed to be on his side understood him in their own way withlimitations and alterations he could not agree to as what he alwayswanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himselfunderstood it he lluminati sought to substitute republican for monarchicalinstitutionst the end of the meeting the rand aster with irony and illwillreproved ezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtuealone but also a love of strife that had moved him in the disputeierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal wouldbe accepted e was told that it would not and without waiting for theusual formalities he left the lodge and went home gain ierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded or threedays after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa athome receiving no one and going nowheret was just then that he received a letter from his wife who imploredhim to see her telling him how grieved she was about him and how shewished to devote her whole life to himt the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she wouldreturn to etersburg from abroadollowing this letter one of the masonic rothers whom ierre respectedless than the others forced his way in to see him and turning theconversation upon ierres matrimonial affairs by way of fraternaladvice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong andthat he was neglecting one of the first rules of reemasonry by notforgiving the penitentt the same time his motherinlaw rince asilis wife sent to himimploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a mostimportant matter ierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him andthat they wanted to reunite him with his wife and in the mood he thenwas this was not even unpleasant to him othing mattered to himothing in life seemed to him of much importance and under theinfluence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither hisliberty nor his resolution to punish his wifeo one is right and no one is to blame so she too is not to blame hethoughtf he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife itwas only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to takeany step ad his wife come to him he would not have turned her awayompared to what preoccupied him was it not a matter of indifferencewhether he lived with his wife or notithout replying either to his wife or his motherinlaw ierre lateone night prepared for a journey and started for oscow to see osephlexeevich his is what he noted in his diaryoscow th ovember have just returned from my benefactor and hasten to write down what have experienced oseph lexeevich is living poorly and has for threeyears been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder o one hasever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint rom morning tilllate at night except when he eats his very plain food he is working atscience e received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed onwhich he lay  made the sign of the nights of the ast and oferusalem and he responded in the same manner asking me with a mildsmile what  had learned and gained in the russian and cottish lodges told him everything as best  could and told him what  had proposedto our etersburg lodge of the bad reception  had encountered and ofmy rupture with the rothers oseph lexeevich having remained silentand thoughtful for a good while told me his view of the matter whichat once lit up for me my whole past and the future path  should followe surprised me by asking whether  remembered the threefold aim of theorder  he preservation and study of the mystery  hepurification and reformation of oneself for its reception and  heimprovement of the human race by striving for such purification hichis the principal aim of these three ertainly selfreformation andselfpurification nly to this aim can we always strive independentlyof circumstances ut at the same time just this aim demands thegreatest efforts of us and so led astray by pride losing sight ofthis aim we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in ourimpurity we are unworthy to receive or seek the reformation of thehuman race while ourselves setting an example of baseness andprofligacy lluminism is not a pure doctrine just because it isattracted by social activity and puffed up by pride n this groundoseph lexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity and in thedepth of my soul  agreed with him alking of my family affairs he saidto me the chief duty of a true ason as  have told you lies inperfecting himself e often think that by removing all the difficultiesof our life we shall more quickly reach our aim but on the contrary mydear sir it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attainour three chief aims  elfknowledgefor man can only know himselfby comparison  elfperfecting which can only be attained byconflict and  he attainment of the chief virtuelove of deathnly the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop ourinnate love of death or of rebirth to a new life hese words are allthe more remarkable because in spite of his great physical sufferingsoseph lexeevich is never weary of life though he loves death forwhichin spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner manhe doesnot yet feel himself sufficiently prepared y benefactor then explainedto me fully the meaning of the reat quare of creation and pointed outto me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything eadvised me not to avoid intercourse with the etersburg rothers but totake up only secondgrade posts in the lodge to try while divertingthe rothers from pride to turn them toward the true path selfknowledge and selfperfecting esides this he advised me for myselfpersonally above all to keep a watch over myself and to that end hegave me a notebook the one  am now writing in and in which  will infuture note down all my actionsetersburg rd ovember am again living with my wife y motherinlaw came to me in tears andsaid that elene was here and that she implored me to hear her that shewas innocent and unhappy at my desertion and much more  knew that if once let myself see her  should not have strength to go on refusingwhat she wanted n my perplexity  did not know whose aid and advice toseek ad my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do went to my room and reread oseph lexeevichs letters and recalled myconversations with him and deduced from it all that  ought not torefuse a supplicant and ought to reach a helping hand to everyoneespecially to one so closely bound to meand that  must bear my crossut if  forgive her for the sake of doing right then let union withher have only a spiritual aim hat is what  decided and what  wroteto oseph lexeevich  told my wife that  begged her to forget thepast to forgive me whatever wrong  may have done her and that  hadnothing to forgive t gave me joy to tell her this he need not knowhow hard it was for me to see her again  have settled on the upperfloor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling ofregeneration t that time as always happens the highest society that met at courtand at the grand balls was divided into several circles each with itsown particular tone he largest of these was the rench circle of theapoleonic alliance the circle of ount umyantsev and aulaincourt nthis group elene as soon as she had settled in

year heonly resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to applyfor an official post so he had come to etersburg to look for one andalso as he said to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last timeoon after their arrival in etersburg erg proposed to era and wasacceptedhough in oscow the ostovs belonged to the best society withoutthemselves giving it a thought yet in etersburg their circle ofacquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one n etersburg they wereprovincials and the very people they had entertained in oscow withoutinquiring to what set they belonged here looked

the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aidedecamp standing nearthe commanderinchief and had taken it to his commander ust as he haddone after usterlitz he related this occurrence at such length and soinsistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to dothis and he received two decorations for the innish war also n he was a captain in the uards wore medals and held some speciallucrative posts in etersburghough some skeptics smiled when told of ergs merits it could not bedenied that he was a painstaking and brave officer on excellent termswith his superiors and a moral young man with a brilliant career beforehim and an assured position in societyour years before meeting a erman comrade in the stalls of a oscowtheater erg had pointed out era ostova to him and had said inerman das soll mein eib werden  and from that moment had made uphis mind to marry her ow in etersburg having considered the ostovsposition and his own he decided that the time had come to propose hat girl shall be my wifeergs proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was notflattering to him t first it seemed strange that the son of an obscureivonian gentleman should propose marriage to a ountess ostova butergs chief characteristic was such a naive and good natured egotismthat the ostovs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thingsince he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good indeedexcellent oreover the ostovs affairs were seriously embarrassed asthe suitor could not but know and above all era was twentyfour hadbeen taken out everywhere and though she was certainly goodlooking andsensible no one up to now had proposed to her o they gave theirconsentou see said erg to his comrade whom he called friend onlybecause he knew that everyone

not the same intelligence he is soyou know npleasant ut my fiancee ell you will be cominghe was going to say to dine but changed his mind and said to taketea with us and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small roundring of tobacco smoke perfectly embodying his dream of happinessfter the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by ergsproposal the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times tookpossession of the family but the rejoicing was external and insinceren the familys feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness andconstraint was evident as if they were ashamed of not having loved erasufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands he oldcount felt this most e would probably have been unable to state thecause of his embarrassment but it resulted from the state of hisaffairs e did not know at all how much he had what his debts amountedto or what dowry he could give era hen his daughters were born hehad assigned to each of them for her dowry an estate with threehundred serfs but one of these estates had already been sold and theother was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it wouldhave to be sold so that it was impossible to give it to era or hadhe any moneyerg had already been engaged a month and only a week remained beforethe wedding but the count had not yet decided in his own mind thequestion of the dowry nor spoken to his wife about it t one time thecount thought of giving her the yazan estate or of selling a forest atanother time of borrowing money on a note of hand  few days before thewedding erg entered the counts study early one morning and with apleasant smile respectfully asked his future fatherinlaw to let himknow what eras dowry would be he count was so disconcerted by thislongforeseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first replythat came into his head  like your being businesslike about it like it ou shall be satisfiednd patting erg on the shoulder he got up wishing to end theconversation ut erg smiling pleasantly explained that if he did notknow for certain how much era would have and did not receive at leastpart of the dowry in advance he would have to break matters offecause consider ountif  allowed myself to marry now withouthaving definite means to maintain my wife  should be acting badlyhe conversation ended by the count who wished to be generous and toavoid further importunity saying that he would give a note of hand foreighty thousand rubles erg smiled meekly kissed the count on theshoulder and said that he was very grateful but that it was impossiblefor him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand inready money r at least twenty thousand ount he added and then anote of hand for only sixty thousandes yes all right said the count hurriedly nly excuse me mydear fellow ll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eightythousand as well es yes iss me atasha was sixteen and it was the year  the very year to which shehad counted on her fingers with oris after they had kissed four yearsago ince then she had not seen him efore onya and her mother iforis happened to be mentioned she spoke quite freely of that episodeas of some childish longforgotten matter that was not worthmentioning ut in the secret depths of her soul the question whetherher engagement to oris was a jest or an important binding promisetormented herince oris left oscow in  to join the army he had not seen theostovs e had been in oscow several times and had passed neartradnoe but had never been to see themometimes it occurred to atasha that he did not wish to see her andthis conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spokeof himowadays old friends are not remembered the countess would say whenoris was mentionednna ikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently seemedto hold herself with particular dignity and always spoke rapturouslyand gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career onwhich he had entered hen the ostovs came to etersburg oris calledon theme drove to their house in some agitation he memory of atasha was hismost poetic recollection ut he went with the firm intention of lettingher and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself andatasha could not be binding either on her or on him e had a brilliantposition in society thanks to his intimacy with ountess ezukhova abrilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of animportant personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed and he wasbeginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses inetersburg plans which might very easily be realized hen he enteredthe ostovs drawing room atasha was in her own room hen she heard ofhis arrival she almost ran into the drawing room flushed and beamingwith a more than cordial smileoris remembered atasha in a short dress with dark eyes shining fromunder her curls and boisterous childish laughter as he had known herfour years before and so he was taken aback when quite a differentatasha entered and his face expressed rapturous astonishment hisexpression on his face pleased atashaell do you recognize your little madcap playmate asked thecountessoris kissed atashas hand and said that he was astonished at thechange in herow handsome you have grown should think so replied atashas laughing eyesnd is apa older she askedatasha sat down and without joining in oris conversation with thecountess silently and minutely studied her childhoods suitor e feltthe weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at heroccasionallyoris uniform spurs tie and the way his hair was brushed were allcomme il faut and in the latest fashion his atasha noticed at oncee sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess arrangingwith his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left handlike a skin and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of hislips about the amusements of the highest etersburg society recallingwith mild irony old times in oscow and oscow acquaintances t was notaccidentally atasha felt that he alluded when speaking of thehighest aristocracy to an ambassadors ball he had attended and toinvitations he had received from  and ll this time atasha sat silent glancing up at him from under herbrows his gaze disturbed and confused oris more and more e lookedround more frequently toward her and broke off in what he was sayinge did not stay more than ten minutes then rose and took his leave hesame inquisitive challenging and rather mocking eyes still looked athim fter his first visit oris said to himself that atasha attractedhim just as much as ever but that he must not yield to that feelingbecause to marry her a girl almost without fortune would mean ruin tohis career while to renew their former relations without intending tomarry her would be dishonorable oris made up his mind to avoid meetingatasha but despite that resolution he called again a few days laterand began calling often and spending whole days at the ostovs tseemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with atasha and tellher that the old times must be forgotten that in spite of everythingshe could not be his wife that he had no means and they would neverlet her marry him ut he failed to do so and felt awkward aboutentering on such an explanation rom day to day he became more and moreentangled t seemed to her mother and onya that atasha was in lovewith oris as of old he sang him his favorite songs showed him heralbum making him write in it did not allow him to allude to the pastletting it be understood how delightful was the present and every dayhe went away in a fog without having said what he meant to and notknowing what he was doing or why he came or how it would all end eleft off visiting elene and received reproachful notes from her everyday and yet he continued to spend whole days with the ostovs ne night when the old countess in nightcap and dressing jacketwithout her false curls and with her poor little knob of hair showingunder her white cotton cap knelt sighing and groaning on a rug andbowing to the ground in prayer her door creaked and atasha also in adressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair incurlpapers ran in he countessher prayerful mood dispelledlookedround and frowned he was

among a minorityof women who crowded near the wall not having been invited to dancehe stood with her slender arms hanging down her scarcely defined bosomrising and falling regularly and with bated breath and glitteringfrightened eyes gazed straight before her evidently prepared for theheight of joy or misery he was not concerned about the mperor or anyof those great people whom eronskaya was pointing outshe had but onethought s it possible no one will ask me that  shall not be amongthe first to dance s it possible that not one of all these men willnotice me hey do not even seem to see me or if they do they look asif they were saying h shes not the one m after so its not worthlooking at her o its impossible she thought hey must know how long to dance how splendidly  dance and how they

and each time turned away ergand his wife who were not dancing came up to themhis family gathering seemed humiliating to atashaas if there werenowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball he did notlisten to or look at era who was telling her something about her owngreen dresst last the mperor stopped beside his last partner he had danced withthree and the music ceased  worried aidedecamp ran up to theostovs requesting them to stand farther back though as it was theywere already close to the wall and from the gallery resounded thedistinct precise enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz he mperorlooked smilingly down the room  minute passed but no one had yet begundancing n aidedecamp the aster of eremonies went up to ountessezukhova and asked her to dance he smilingly raised her hand and laidit on his shoulder without looking at him he aidedecamp an adept inhis art grasping his partner firmly round her waist with confidentdeliberation started smoothly gliding first round the edge of thecircle then at the corner of the room he caught elenes left hand andturned her the only sound audible apart from the everquickeningmusic being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his rapid agile feetwhile at every third beat his partners velvet dress spread out andseemed to flash as she whirled round atasha gazed at them and wasready to cry because it was not she who was dancing that first turn ofthe waltzrince ndrew in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel wearingstockings and dancing shoes stood looking animated and bright in thefront row of the circle not far from the ostovs aron irhoff wastalking to him about the first sitting of the ouncil of tate to beheld next day rince ndrew as one closely connected with peranskiand participating in the work of the legislative commission could givereliable information about that sitting concerning which various rumorswere current ut not listening to what irhoff was saying he wasgazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance whohad not yet gathered courage to enter the circlerince ndrew was watching these men abashed by the mperors presenceand the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to danceierre came up to him and caught him by the armou always dance  have a protegee the young ostova here sk herhe saidhere is she asked olkonski xcuse me he added turning to thebaron we will finish this conversation elsewhereat a ball one mustdance e stepped forward in the direction ierre indicated hedespairing dejected expression of atashas face caught his eye erecognized her

rapture suddenlybrightened into a happy grateful childlike smile have long been waiting for you that frightened happy little girlseemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears as sheraised her hand to rince ndrews shoulder hey were the second coupleto enter the circle rince ndrew was one of the best dancers of hisday and atasha danced exquisitely er little feet in their white satindancing shoes did their work swiftly lightly and independently ofherself while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness er slender barearms and neck were not beautifulcompared to elenes her shoulderslooked thin and her bosom undeveloped ut elene seemed as it werehardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scannedher person while atasha was like a girl exposed for the first timewho would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that thiswas absolutely necessaryrince ndrew liked dancing and wishing to escape as quickly aspossible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed tohim wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he dislikedcaused by the mperors presence he danced and had chosen atashabecause ierre pointed her out to him and because she was the firstpretty girl who caught his eye but scarcely had he embraced thatslender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smilingso near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head and he felthimself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stoodbreathing deeply and watching the other dancers fter rince ndrew oris came up to ask atasha for a dance and thenthe aidedecamp who had opened the ball and several other young menso that flushed and happy and passing on her superfluous partners toonya she did not cease dancing all the evening he noticed and sawnothing of what occupied everyone else ot only did she fail to noticethat the mperor talked a long time with the rench ambassador and howparticularly gracious he was to a certain lady or that rince oandsoand oandso did and said this and that and that elene had greatsuccess and was honored by the special attention of oandso but shedid not even see the mperor and only noticed that he had gone becausethe ball became livelier after his departure or one of the merrycotillions before supper rince ndrew was again her partner ereminded her of their first encounter in the tradnoe avenue and howshe had been unable to sleep that moonlight night and told her how hehad involuntarily overheard her atasha blushed at that recollectionand tried to excuse herself as if there had been something to beashamed of in what rince ndrew had overheardike all men who have grown up in society rince ndrew liked meetingsomeone there not of the conventional society stamp nd such wasatasha with her surprise her delight her shyness and even hermistakes in speaking rench ith her he behaved with special care andtenderness sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and mostunimportant matters he admired her shy grace n the middle of thecotillion having completed one of the figures atasha still out ofbreath was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her he wastired and panting and evidently thought of declining but immediatelyput her hand gaily on the mans shoulder smiling at rince ndrewd be glad to sit beside you and rest m tired but you see how theykeep asking me and m glad of it m happy and  love everybody andyou and  understand it all and much much more was said in her smilehen her partner left her atasha ran across the room to choose twoladies for the figuref she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady she will bemy wife said rince ndrew to himself quite to his own surprise as hewatched her he did go first to her cousinhat rubbish sometimes enters ones head thought rince ndrew butwhat is certain is that that girl is so charming so original that shewont be dancing here a month before she will be married uch as sheare rare here he thought as atasha readjusting a rose that wasslipping on her bodice settled herself beside himhen the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up tothe dancers e invited rince ndrew to come and see them and askedhis daughter whether she was enjoying herself atasha did not answer atonce but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully ow canyou ask such a question have never enjoyed myself so much before she said and rincendrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace herfather and instantly dropped again atasha was happier than she hadever been in her life he was at that height of bliss when one becomescompletely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility ofevil unhappiness or sorrowt that ball ierre for the first time felt humiliated by the positionhis wife occupied in court circles e was gloomy and absentminded deep furrow ran across his forehead and standing by a window he staredover his spectacles seeing no onen her way to supper atasha passed himierres gloomy unhappy look struck her he stopped in front of himhe wished to help him to bestow on him the superabundance of her ownhappinessow delightful it is ount said she snt itierre smiled absentmindedly evidently not grasping what she saides  am very glad he saidow can people be dissatisfied with anything thought atashaspecially such a capital fellow as ezukhov n atashas eyes allthe people at the ball alike were good kind and splendid peopleloving one another none of them capable of injuring anotherand sothey ought all to be happy ext day rince ndrew thought of the ball but his mind did not dwellon it long es it was a very brilliant ball and then es thatlittle ostova is very charming heres something fresh original unetersburglike about her that distinguishes her hat was all hethought about yesterdays ball and after his morning tea he set toworkut either from fatigue or want of sleep he was illdisposed for workand could get nothing done e kept criticizing his own work as heoften did and was glad when he heard someone cominghe visitor was itski who served on various committees frequented allthe societies in etersburg and a passionate devotee of the new ideasand of peranski and a diligent etersburg newsmongerone of those menwho choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashionbut who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans ardlyhad he got rid of his hat before he ran into rince ndrews room with apreoccupied air and at once began talking e had just heard particularsof that mornings sitting of the ouncil of tate opened by the mperorand he spoke of it enthusiastically he mperors speech had beenextraordinary t had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchsdeliver he overeign plainly said that the ouncil and enate areestates of the realm he said that the government must rest not onauthority but on secure bases he mperor said that the fiscal systemmust be reorganized and the accounts published recounted itskiemphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantlyh yes odays events mark an epoch the greatest epoch in ourhistory he concludedrince ndrew listened to the account of the opening of the ouncil oftate which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attachedsuch importance and was surprised that this event now that it hadtaken place did not affect him and even seemed quite insignificant elistened with quiet irony to itskis enthusiastic account of it  verysimple thought occurred to him hat does it matter to me or to itskiwhat the mperor was pleased to say at the ouncil an all that make meany happier or betternd this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest rincendrew had felt in the impending reforms e was going to dine thatevening at peranskis with only a few friends as the host had saidwhen inviting him he prospect of that dinner in the intimate homecircle of the man he so admired had greatly interested rince ndrewespecially as he had not yet seen peranski in his domesticsurroundings but now he felt disinclined to go to itt the appointed hour however he entered the modest house peranskiowned in the aurida ardens n the parqueted dining room this smallhouse remarkable for its extreme cleanliness suggesting that of amonastery rince ndrew who was rather late found the friendlygathering of peranskis intimate acquaintances already assembled atfive oclock here were no ladies present except peranskis littledaughter longfaced like her father and her governess he otherguests were ervais agnitski and tolypin hile still in theanteroom rince ndrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laughalaugh such as one hears on the stage omeoneit sounded likeperanskiwas distinctly ejaculating hahaha rince ndrew had neverbefore heard peranskis famous laugh and this ringing highpitchedlaughter from a statesman made a strange impression on hime entered the dining room he whole company were standing between twowindows at a small table laid with horsdoeuvres peranski wearing agray swallowtail coat with a star on the breast and evidently stillthe same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting ofthe ouncil of tate stood at the table with a beaming countenance isguests surrounded him agnitski addressing himself to peranski wasrelating an anecdote and peranski was laughing in advance at whatagnitski was going to say hen rince ndrew entered the roomagnitskis words were again crowned by laughter tolypin gave a deepbass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese ervais laughedsoftly with a hissing chuckle and peranski in a highpitched staccatomannertill laughing peranski held out his soft white hand to rince ndrewery pleased to see you rince he said ne moment he went onturning to agnitski and interrupting his story e have agreed thatthis is a dinner for recreation with not a word about business andturning again to the narrator he began to laugh afreshrince ndrew looked at the laughing peranski with astonishmentregret and disillusionment t seemed to him that this was notperanski but someone else verything that had formerly appearedmysterious and fascinating in peranski suddenly became plain andunattractivet dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed toconsist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes efore agnitskihad finished his story someone else was anxious to relate somethingstill funnier ost of the anecdotes if not relating to the stateservice related to people in the service t seemed that in thiscompany the insignificance of those people was so definitely acceptedthat the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humoredridicule peranski related how at the ouncil that morning a deafdignitary when asked his opinion replied that he thought so tooervais gave a long account of an official revision remarkable for thestupidity of everybody concerned tolypin stuttering broke into theconversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existedunder the former order of thingsthreatening to give a serious turn tothe conversation agnitski starting quizzing tolypin about hisvehemence ervais intervened with a joke and the talk reverted to itsformer lively tonevidently peranski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement ina circle of friends and his guests understanding his wish tried toenliven him and amuse themselves ut their gaiety seemed to rincendrew mirthless and tiresome peranskis highpitched voice struck himunpleasantly and the incessant laughter grated on him like a falsenote rince ndrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damperon the spirits of the company but no one took any notice of his beingout of harmony with the general mood hey all seemed very gaye tried several times to join in the conversation but his remarks weretossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water and he couldnot jest with themhere was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said it was witty andmight have been funny but it lacked just that something which is thesalt of mirth and they were not even aware that such a thing existedfter dinner peranskis daughter and her governess rose e patted thelittle girl with his white hand and kissed her nd that gesture tooseemed unnatural to rince ndrewhe men remained at table over their portnglish fashion n the midstof a conversation that was started about apoleons panish affairswhich they all agreed in approving rince ndrew began to express acontrary opinion peranski smiled and with an evident wish to preventthe conversation from taking an unpleasant course told a story that hadno connection with the previous conversation or a few moments all weresilentaving sat some time at table peranski corked a bottle of wine andremarking owadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair passed itto the servant and got up ll rose and continuing to talk loudly wentinto the drawing room wo letters brought by a courier were handed toperanski and he took them to his study s soon as he had left the roomthe general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensiblyand quietly with one anotherow for the recitation said peranski on returning from his study wonderful talent he said to rince ndrew and agnitski immediatelyassumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in rench whichhe had composed about various wellknown etersburg people e wasinterrupted several times by applause hen the verses were finishedrince ndrew went up to peranski and took his leavehere are you off to so early asked peranski promised to go to a receptionhey said no more rince ndrew looked closely into those mirrorlikeimpenetrable eyes and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to haveexpected anything from peranski and from any of his own activitiesconnected with him or ever to have attributed importance to whatperanski was doing hat precise mirthless laughter rang in rincendrews ears long after he had left the househen he reached home rince ndrew began thinking of his life inetersburg during those last four months as if it were something new erecalled his exertions and solicitations and the history of his projectof army reform which had been accepted for consideration and which theywere trying to pass over in silence simply because another a very poorone had already been prepared and submitted to the mperor e thoughtof the meetings of a committee of which erg was a member e rememberedhow carefully and at what length everything relating to form andprocedure was discussed at those meetings and how sedulously andpromptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded erecalled his labors on the egal ode and how painstakingly he hadtranslated the articles of the oman and rench codes into ussian andhe felt ashamed of himself hen he vividly pictured to himselfogucharovo his occupations in the country his journey to yazan heremembered the peasants and ron the village elder and mentallyapplying to them the ersonal ights he had divided into paragraphs hefelt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such uselesswork ext day rince ndrew called at a few houses he had not visited beforeand among them at the ostovs with whom he had renewed acquaintance atthe ball part from considerations of politeness which demanded thecall he wanted to see that original eager girl who had left such apleasant impression on his mind in her own homeatasha was one of the first to meet him he was wearing a darkbluehouse dress in which rince ndrew thought her even prettier than in herball dress he and all the ostov family welcomed him as an old friendsimply and cordially he whole family whom he had formerly judgedseverely now seemed to him to consist of excellent simple and kindlypeople he old counts hospitality and good nature which struck oneespecially in etersburg as a pleasant surprise were such that rincendrew could not refuse to stay to dinner es he thought they arecapital people who of course have not the slightest idea what atreasure they possess in atasha but they are kindly folk and form thebest possible setting for this strikingly poetic charming girloverflowing with lifen atasha rince ndrew was conscious of a strange world completelyalien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him a different world thatin the tradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night hadalready begun to disconcert him ow this world disconcerted him nolonger and was no longer alien to him but he himself having entered itfound in it a new enjoymentfter dinner atasha at rince ndrews request went to the clavichordand began singing rince ndrew stood by a window talking to the ladiesand listened to her n the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking andsuddenly felt tears choking him a thing he had thought impossible forhim e looked at atasha as she sang and something new and joyfulstirred in his soul e felt happy and at the same time sad e hadabsolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep hat aboutis former love he little princess is disillusionments is hopesfor the future es and no he chief reason was a sudden vividsense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great andillimitable within him and that limited and material something that heand even she was his contrast weighed on and yet cheered him whileshe sangs soon as atasha had finished she went up to him and asked how heliked her voice he asked this and then became confused feeling thatshe ought not to have asked it e smiled looking at her and said heliked her singing as he liked everything she didrince ndrew left the ostovs late in the evening e went to bed fromhabit but soon realized that he could not sleep aving lit his candlehe sat up in bed then got up then lay down again not at all troubledby his sleeplessness his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he hadstepped out of a stuffy room into ods own fresh air t did not enterhis head that he was in love with atasha he was not thinking abouther but only picturing her to himself and in consequence all lifeappeared in a new light hy do  strive why do  toil in this narrowconfined frame when life all life with all its joys is open to mesaid he to himself nd for the first time for a very long while hebegan making happy plans for the future e decided that he must attendto his sons education by finding a tutor and putting

men must sometimes have masculine conversationsaid hehey received ierre in their small new drawingroom where it wasimpossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetryneatness and order so it was quite comprehensible and not strange thaterg having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchairor of the sofa for his dear guest but being apparently painfullyundecided on the matter himself eventually left the visitor to settlethe question of selection ierre disturbed the symmetry by moving achair for himself and erg and era immediately began their eveningparty interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain theirguestera having decided in her own mind that ierre ought to be entertainedwith conversation about the rench embassy at once began accordinglyerg having decided that masculine conversation was requiredinterrupted his wifes remarks and touched on the question of the warwith ustria and unconsciously jumped from the general subject topersonal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in theustrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them hough theconversation was very incoherent and era was angry at the intrusion ofthe masculine element both husband and wife felt with satisfactionthat even if only one guest was present their evening had begun verywell and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with itstalk tea and lighted candlesefore long oris ergs old comrade arrived here was a shade ofcondescension and patronage in his treatment of erg and era fteroris came a lady with the colonel then the general himself then theostovs and the party became unquestionably exactly like all otherevening parties erg and era could not repress their smiles ofsatisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room atthe sound of the disconnected talk the rustling of dresses and thebowing and scraping verything was just as everybody always has itespecially so the general who admired the apartment patted erg on theshoulder and with parental authority superintended the setting out ofthe table for boston he general sat down by ount lya ostov who wasnext to himself the most important guest he old people sat with theold the young with the young and the hostess at the tea table onwhich stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket asthe anins had at their party verything was just as it was everywhereelse ierre as one of the principal guests had to sit down to boston withount ostov the general and the colonel t the card table hehappened to be directly facing atasha and was struck by a curiouschange that had come over her since the ball he was silent and notonly less pretty than at the ball but only redeemed from plainness byher look of gentle indifference to everything aroundhats the matter with her thought ierre glancing at her he wassitting by her sister at the tea table and reluctantly without lookingat him made some reply to oris who sat down beside her fter playingout a whole suit and to his partners delight taking five tricksierre hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered theroom while he was picking up his tricks glanced again at atashahat has happened to her he asked himself with still greatersurpriserince ndrew was standing before her saying something to her with alook of tender solicitude he having raised her head was looking upat him flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing ndthe bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was againalight in her he was completely transformed and from a plain girl hadagain become what she had been at the ballrince ndrew went up to ierre and the latter noticed a new andyouthful expression in his friends faceierre changed places several times during the game sitting now withhis back to atasha and now facing her but during the whole of the sixrubbers he watched her and his friendomething very important is happening between them thought ierreand a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made himneglect the gamefter six rubbers the general got up saying that it was no use playinglike that and ierre was released atasha on one side was talking withonya and oris and era with a subtle smile was saying something torince ndrew ierre went up to his friend and asking whether theywere talking secrets sat down beside them era having noticed rincendrews attentions to atasha decided that at a party a real eveningparty subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessaryand seizing a moment when rince ndrew was alone began a conversationwith him about feelings in general and about her sister ith sointellectual a guest as she considered rince ndrew to be she feltthat she had to employ her diplomatic tacthen ierre went up to them he noticed that era was being carried awayby her selfsatisfied talk but that rince ndrew seemed embarrassed athing that rarely happened with himhat do you think era was saying with an arch smile ou are sodiscerning rince and understand peoples characters so well at aglance hat do you think of atalie ould she be constant in herattachments ould she like other women era meant herself love aman once for all and remain true to him forever hat is what  considertrue love hat do you think rince know your sister too little replied rince ndrew with a sarcasticsmile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment to be able tosolve so delicate a question and then  have noticed that the lessattractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be he addedand looked up at ierre who was just approaching themes that is true rince n our days continued eramentioningour days as people of limited intelligence are fond of doingimagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities ofour days and that human characteristics change with the timesin ourdays a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted oftenstifles real feeling in her nd it must be confessed that atalie isvery susceptible his return to the subject of atalie caused rincendrew to knit his brows with discomfort he was about to rise but eracontinued with a still more subtle smile think no one has been more courted than she she went on but tillquite lately she never cared seriously for anyone ow you know ountshe said to ierre even our dear cousin oris who between ourselveswas very far gone in the land of tenderness alluding to a map oflove much in vogue at that timerince ndrew frowned and remained silentou are friendly with oris arent you asked eraes  know him expect he has told you of his childish love for atashah there was childish love suddenly asked rince ndrew blushingunexpectedlyes you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love ecousinage est un dangereux voisinage  ont you think so ousinhood is a dangerous neighborhoodh undoubtedly said rince ndrew and with sudden and unnaturalliveliness he began chaffing ierre about the need to be very carefulwith his fiftyyearold oscow cousins and in the midst of thesejesting remarks he rose taking ierre by the arm and drew him asideell asked ierre seeing his friends strange animation withsurprise and noticing the glance he turned on atasha as he rose must  must have a talk with you said rince ndrew ou knowthat pair of womens gloves e referred to the masonic gloves givento a newly initiated rother to present to the woman he loved but no  will talk to you later on and with a strange light in hiseyes and restlessness in his movements rince ndrew approached atashaand sat down beside her ierre saw how rince ndrew asked hersomething and how she flushed as she repliedut at that moment erg came to ierre and began insisting that heshould take part in an argument between the general and the colonel onthe affairs in painerg was satisfied and happy he smile of pleasure never left his facehe party was very successful and quite like other parties he had

eveningparties he wished to imitate hey had not yet had a loud conversationamong the men and a dispute about something important and clever owthe general had begun such a discussion and so erg drew ierre to it ext day having been invited by the count rince ndrew dined with theostovs and spent the rest of the day thereveryone in the house realized for whose sake rince ndrew came andwithout concealing it he tried to be with atasha all day ot only inthe soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured atasha but in thewhole house there was a feeling of awe at something important that wasbound to happen he countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyesat rince ndrew when he talked to atasha and timidly started someartificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her wayonya was afraid to leave atasha and afraid of being in the way whenshe was with them atasha grew pale in a panic of expectation whenshe remained alone with him for a moment rince ndrew surprised her byhis timidity he felt that he wanted to say something to her but couldnot bring himself to do son the evening when rince ndrew had left the countess went up toatasha and whispered ell whatamma or heavens sake dont ask me anything now ne cant talkabout that said atashaut all the same that night atasha now agitated and now frightenedlay a long time in her mothers bed gazing straight before her

her mother ow goll the same  shant sleep hat silliness to sleep ummy ummysuch a thing never happened to me before she said surprised andalarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself nd could we everhave thoughtt seemed to atasha that even at the time she first saw rince ndrewat tradnoe she had fallen in love with him t was as if she fearedthis strange unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she hadthen chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and of findinghim as it seemed not indifferent to hernd it had to happen that he should come specially to etersburg whilewe are here nd it had to happen that we should meet at that ball tis fate learly it is fate that everything led up to this lreadythen directly  saw him  felt something peculiarhat else did he say to you hat

telling himof his love for atasha and his firm resolve to make her his wifehat day ountess elene had a reception at her house he renchambassador was there and a foreign prince of the blood who had of latebecome a frequent visitor of hers and many brilliant ladies andgentlemen ierre who had come downstairs walked through the rooms andstruck everyone by his preoccupied absentminded and morose airince the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depressionand had made desperate efforts to combat it ince the intimacy of hiswife with the royal prince ierre had unexpectedly been made agentleman of the bedchamber and from that time he had begun to feeloppressed and ashamed in court society and dark thoughts of the vanityof all things human came to him oftener than before t the same timethe feeling he had noticed between his protegee atasha and rincendrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own positionand his friends e tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife andabout atasha and rince ndrew and again everything seemed to himinsignificant in comparison with eternity again the question for whatpresented itself and he forced himself to work day and night at masoniclabors hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him owardmidnight after he had left the countess apartments he was sittingupstairs in a shabby dressing gown copying out the original transactionof the cottish lodge of reemasons at a table in his low room cloudywith tobacco smoke when someone came in t was rince ndrewh its you said ierre with a preoccupied dissatisfied air nd you see am hard at it e pointed to his manuscript book with thatair of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look attheir workrince ndrew with a beaming ecstatic expression of renewed life onhis face paused in front of ierre and not noticing his sad looksmiled at him with the egotism of joyell dear heart said he  wanted to tell you about it yesterdayand  have come to do so today  never experienced anything like itbefore  am in love my frienduddenly ierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down onthe sofa beside rince ndrewith atasha ostova yes said hees yes ho else should it be  should never have believed it butthe feeling is stronger than  esterday  tormented myself andsuffered but  would not exchange even that torment for anything in theworld  have not lived till now t last  live but  cant livewithout her ut can she love me  am too old for her hy dontyou speak  hat did  tell you said ierre suddenly rising and beginningto pace up and down the room  always thought it hat girl is sucha treasure she is a rare girl y dear friend  entreat youdont philosophize dont doubt marry marry marry nd  am surethere will not be a happier man than youut what of herhe loves youont talk rubbish said rince ndrew smiling and looking intoierres eyeshe does  know ierre cried fiercelyut do listen returned rince ndrew holding him by the arm o youknow the condition  am in  must talk about it to someoneell go on go on  am very glad said ierre and his face reallychanged his brow became smooth and he listened gladly to rincendrew rince ndrew seemed and really was quite a different quite anew man here was his spleen his contempt for life hisdisillusionment ierre was the only person to whom he made up his mindto speak openly and to him he told all that was in his soul ow heboldly and lightly made plans for an extended future said he could notsacrifice his own happiness to his fathers caprice and spoke of how hewould either make his father consent to this marriage and love her orwould do without his consent then he marveled at the feeling that hadmastered him as at something strange apart from and independent ofhimself should not have believed anyone who told me that  was capable ofsuch love said rince ndrew t is not at all the same feeling that knew in the past he whole world is now for me divided into twohalves one half is she and there all is joy hope light the otherhalf is everything where she is not and there is all gloom anddarknessarkness and gloom reiterated ierre yes yes  understand that cannot help loving the light it is not my fault nd  am veryhappy ou understand me  know you are glad for my sakees yes ierre assented looking at his friend with a touched andsad expression in his eyes he brighter rince ndrews lot appeared tohim the gloomier seemed his own rince ndrew needed his fathers consent to his marriage and to obtainthis he started for the country next dayis father received his sons communication with external composure butinward wrath e could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter hislife or introduce anything new into it when his own life was alreadyending f only they would let me end my days as  want to thoughtthe old man then they might do as they please ith his son howeverhe employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions andadopting a quiet tone discussed the whole mattern the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regardsbirth wealth or rank econdly rince ndrew was no longer as youngas he had been and his health was poor the old man laid special stresson this while she was very young hirdly he had a son whom it wouldbe a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl ourthly and finally thefather said looking ironically at his son  beg you to put it off fora year go abroad take a cure look out as you wanted to for a ermantutor for rince icholas hen if your love or passion or obstinacyasyou pleaseis still as great marry nd thats my last word on itind the last concluded the prince in a tone which showed thatnothing would make him alter his decisionrince ndrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings orhis fiancees would not stand a years test or that he the old princehimself would die before then and he decided to conform to hisfathers wishto propose and postpone the wedding for a yearhree weeks after the last evening he had spent with the ostovs rincendrew returned to etersburgext day after her talk with her mother atasha expected olkonski allday but he did not come n the second and third day it was the sameierre did not come either and atasha not knowing that rince ndrewhad gone to see his father could not explain his absence to herselfhree weeks passed in this way atasha had no desire to go out anywhereand wandered from room to

andbegan singing her solfeggio hen she had finished her first exerciseshe stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase thatparticularly pleased her he listened joyfully as though she had notexpected it to the charm of the notes reverberating filling the wholeempty ballroom and slowly dying away and all at once she feltcheerful hats the good of making so much of it hings are

of itthat he had given his word and bound himself forever but that he didnot wish to bind atasha and gave her perfect freedom f after sixmonths she felt that she did not love him she would have full right toreject him aturally neither atasha nor her parents wished to hear ofthis but rince ndrew was firm e came every day to the ostovs butdid not behave to atasha as an affianced lover he did not use thefamiliar thou but said you to her and kissed only her hand ftertheir engagement quite different intimate and natural relationssprang up between them t was as if they had not known each other tillnow oth liked to recall how they had regarded each other when as yetthey were nothing to one another they felt themselves now quitedifferent beings then they were artificial now natural and sincere tfirst the family felt some constraint in intercourse with rince ndrewhe seemed a man from another world and for a long time atasha trainedthe family to get used to him proudly assuring them all that he onlyappeared to be different but was really just like all of them and thatshe was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be fter a few daysthey grew accustomed to him and without restraint in his presencepursued their usual way of life in which he took his part e couldtalk about rural economy with the count fashions with the countess andatasha and about albums and fancywork with onya ometimes thehousehold both among themselves and in his presence expressed theirwonder at how it had all happened and at the evident omens there hadbeen of it rince ndrews coming to tradnoe and their coming toetersburg and the likeness between atasha and rince ndrew which hernurse had noticed on his first visit and ndrews encounter withicholas in  and many other incidents betokening that it had to ben the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which alwaysaccompanies the presence of a betrothed couple ften when all sittingtogether everyone kept silent ometimes the others would get up and goaway and the couple left alone still remained silent hey rarelyspoke of their future life rince ndrew was afraid and ashamed tospeak of it atasha shared this as she did all his feelings which sheconstantly divined nce she began questioning him about his son rincendrew blushed as he often did nowatasha particularly liked it inhimand said that his son would not live with themhy not asked atasha in a frightened tone cannot take him away from his grandfather and besidesow  should have loved him said atasha immediately guessing histhought but  know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding faultwith usometimes the old count would come up kiss rince ndrew and ask hisadvice about etyas education or icholas service he old countesssighed as she looked at them onya was always getting frightened lestshe should be in the way and tried to find excuses for leaving themalone even when they did not wish it hen rince ndrew spoke hecould tell a story very well atasha listened to him with pride whenshe spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed attentively andscrutinizingly at her he asked herself in perplexity hat does helook for in me e is trying to discover something by looking at mehat if what he seeks in me is not there ometimes she fell into oneof the mad merry moods characteristic of her and then she particularlyloved to hear and see how rince ndrew laughed e seldom laughed butwhen he did he abandoned himself entirely to his laughter and aftersuch a laugh she always felt nearer to him atasha would have beencompletely happy if the thought of the separation awaiting her anddrawing near had not terrified her just as the mere thought of it madehim turn pale and coldn the eve of his departure from etersburg rince ndrew brought withhim ierre who had not been to the ostovs once since the ball ierreseemed disconcerted and embarrassed e was talking to the countess andatasha sat down beside a little chess table with onya therebyinviting rince ndrew to come

onya nor rince ndrew himselfcould have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act onatasha lushed and agitated she went about the house all that daydryeyed occupied with most trivial matters as if not understandingwhat awaited her he did not even cry when on taking leave he kissedher hand for the last time ont go she said in a tone that made himwonder whether he really ought not to stay

unkind thoughts had todie nd what do you think dear friend ive years have passed sincethen and already  with my petty understanding begin to see clearlywhy she had to die and in what way that death was but an expression ofthe infinite goodness of the reator whose every action thoughgenerally incomprehensible to us is but a manifestation of is infinitelove for is creatures erhaps  often think she was too angelicallyinnocent to have the strength to perform all a mothers duties s ayoung wife she was irreproachable perhaps she could not have been so asa mother s it is not only has she left us and particularly rincendrew with the purest regrets and memories but probably she willthere receive a place  dare not hope for myself ut not to speak ofher alone that early and terrible death has had the most beneficentinfluence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief hen atthe moment of our loss these thoughts could not occur to me  shouldthen have dismissed them with horror but now they are very clear andcertain  write all this to you dear friend only to convince you ofthe ospel truth which has become for me a principle of life not asingle hair of our heads will fall without is will nd is will isgoverned only by infinite love for us and so whatever befalls us is forour goodou ask whether we shall spend next winter in oscow n spite of mywish to see you  do not think so and do not want to do so ou will besurprised to hear that the reason for this is uonaparte he case isthis my fathers health is growing noticeably worse he cannot standany contradiction and is becoming irritable his irritability is asyou know chiefly directed to political questions e cannot endure thenotion that uonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all thesovereigns of urope and particularly with our own the grandson of thereat atherine s you know  am quite indifferent to politics butfrom my fathers remarks and his talks with ichael vanovich  know allthat goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred onuonaparte who only at ald ills in the whole world it seems is notaccepted as a great man still less as mperor of rance nd my fathercannot stand this t seems to me that it is chiefly because of hispolitical views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to oscowfor he foresees the encounters that would result from his way ofexpressing his views regardless of anybody ll the benefit he mightderive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of thedisputes about uonaparte which would be inevitable n any case it willbe decided very shortlyur family life goes on in the old way except for my brother ndrewsabsence e as  wrote you before has changed very much of late fterhis sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits e has againbecome as  used to

lost the grief of that loss has gone toodeep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and ourlittle angel a stepmother econdly because as far as  know that girlis not the kind of

legend tells us that the absence of laboridlenesswas acondition of the first mans blessedness before the all allen man hasretained a love of idleness but the curse weighs on the race not onlybecause we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows but becauseour moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease ninner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle f man couldfind a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling hisduty he would have found one of the conditions of mans primitiveblessedness nd such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idlenessis the lot of a whole classthe military he chief attraction ofmilitary service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory andirreproachable idlenessicholas ostov experienced this blissful condition to the full whenafter  he continued to serve in the avlograd regiment in which healready commanded the squadron he had taken over from enisovostov had become a bluff goodnatured fellow whom his oscowacquaintances would have considered rather bad form but who was likedand respected by his comrades subordinates and superiors and was wellcontented with his life f late in  he found in letters from homemore frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were fallinginto greater and greater disorder and that it was time for him to comeback to gladden and comfort his old parentseading these letters icholas felt a dread of their wanting to takehim away from surroundings in which protected from all theentanglements of life he was living so calmly and quietly e felt thatsooner or later he would have to reenter that whirlpool of life withits embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out its accounts withstewards quarrels and intrigues its ties society and with onyaslove and his promise to her t was all dreadfully difficult andcomplicated and he replied to his mother in cold formal letters inrench beginning y dear amma and ending our obedient sonwhich said nothing of when he would return n  he received lettersfrom his parents in which they told him of atashas engagement toolkonski and that the wedding would be in a years time because theold prince made difficulties his letter grieved and mortifiedicholas n the first place he was sorry that atasha for whom hecared more than for anyone else in the family should be lost to thehome and secondly from his hussar point of view he regretted not tohave been there to show that fellow olkonski that connection with himwas no such great honor after all and that if he loved atasha he mightdispense with permission from his dotard father or a moment hehesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see atashabefore she was married but then came the maneuvers and considerationsabout onya and about the confusion of their affairs and icholas againput it off ut in the spring of that year he received a letter fromhis mother written without his fathers knowledge and that letterpersuaded him to return he wrote that if he did not come and takematters in hand their whole property would be sold by auction and theywould all have to go begging he count was so weak and trusted itenkaso much and was so goodnatured that everybody took advantage of himand things were going from bad to worse or ods sake  implore youcome at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole familywretched wrote the countesshis letter touched icholas e had that common sense of a matteroffact man which showed him what he ought to dohe right thing now was if not to retire from the service at any rateto go home on leave hy he had to go he did not know but after hisafterdinner nap he gave orders to saddle ars an extremely viciousgray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time and when hereturned with the horse all in a lather he informed avrushkaenisovs servant who had remained with him and his comrades whoturned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was goinghome ifficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he wouldgo away without having heard from the staffand this interested himextremelywhether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive therder of t nne for the last maneuvers strange as it was to thinkthat he would go away without having sold his three roans to the olishount olukhovski who was bargaining for the horses ostov had bettedhe would sell for two thousand rubles incomprehensible as it seemedthat the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the olishademoiselle rzazdziecka out of rivalry to the uhlans who had givenone in honor of their olish ademoiselle orzozowska would take placewithout himhe knew he must go away from this good bright world tosomewhere where everything was stupid and confused  week later heobtained his leave is hussar comradesnot only those of his ownregiment but the whole brigadegave ostov a dinner to which thesubscription was fifteen rubles a head and at which there were twobands and two choirs of singers ostov danced the repak with ajorasov the tipsy officers tossed embraced and dropped ostov thesoldiers of the third squadron tossed him too and shouted hurrah andthen they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the firstpost stationuring the first half of the journeyfrom remenchug to ievallostovs thoughts as is usual in such cases were behind him with thesquadron but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget histhree roans and ozhoyveyko his quartermaster and to wonder anxiouslyhow things would be at tradnoe and what he would find there houghtsof home grew stronger the nearer he approached itfar stronger asthough this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force ofattraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance tthe last post station before tradnoe he gave the driver a threerubletip and on arriving he ran breathlessly like a boy up the steps ofhis homefter the rapture of meeting and after that odd feeling of unsatisfiedexpectationthe feeling that everything is just the same so why did hurryicholas began to settle down in his old home world is fatherand mother were much the same only a little older hat was new in themwas a certain uneasiness and occasional discord which there used not tobe and which as icholas soon found out was due to the bad state oftheir affairs onya was nearly twenty she had stopped growing prettierand promised nothing more than she was already but that was enough heexhaled happiness and love from the time icholas returned and thefaithful unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on himetya and atasha surprised icholas most etya was a big handsome boyof thirteen merry witty and mischievous with a voice that wasalready breaking s for atasha for a long while icholas wondered andlaughed whenever he looked at heroure not the same at all he saidow m  ugliern the contrary but what dignity  princess he whispered to heres yes yes cried atasha joyfullyhe told him about her romance with rince ndrew and of his visit totradnoe and showed him his last letterell are you glad atasha asked  am so tranquil and happy nowery glad answered icholas e is an excellent

provingto him that it could not be otherwise and that it would be a bad thingto enter a family against the fathers will and that she herself wishedit soou dont at all understand she saidicholas was silent and agreed with herer brother often wondered as he looked at her he did not seem at alllike a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband he was eventempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old his amazed icholasand even made him regard olkonskis courtship skeptically e could notbelieve that her fate was sealed especially as he had not seen her withrince ndrew t always seemed to him that there was something notquite right about this intended marriagehy this delay hy no betrothal he thought nce when he hadtouched on this topic with his mother he discovered to his surpriseand somewhat to his satisfaction that in the depth of her soul she toohad doubts about this marriageou see he writes said she showing her son a letter of rincendrews with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to adaughters future married happiness he writes that he wont comebefore ecember hat can be keeping him llness probably is healthis very delicate ont tell atasha nd dont attach importance to herbeing so bright thats because shes living through the last days ofher girlhood but  know what she is like every time we receive a letterfrom him owever od grant that everything turns out well healways ended with these words e is an excellent man fter reaching home icholas was at first serious and even dull e wasworried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid businessmatters for which his mother had called him home o throw off thisburden as quickly as possible on the third day after his arrival hewent angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where hewas going to itenkas lodge and demanded an account of everything utwhat an account of everything might be icholas knew even less than thefrightened and bewildered itenka he conversation and

by the thought that now their affairs would certainlyimprove but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect thisexcitement might have on her son he went several times to his door ontiptoe and listened as he lighted one pipe after anotherext day the old count called his son aside and with an embarrassedsmile said to himut you know my dear boy its a pity you got excited itenka hastold me all

ikhaylovna fortwo thousand rubles and asked him what he thought of doing with ithis answered icholas ou say it rests with me ell  dont likenna ikhaylovna and  dont like oris but they were our friends andpoor ell then this and he tore up the note and by so doing causedthe old countess to weep tears of joy fter that young ostov took nofurther part in any business affairs but devoted himself withpassionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuitthe chaseforwhich his father kept a large establishment he weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed anearth saturated by autumn rains he verdure had thickened and itsbright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter ryetrodden down by the cattle and against the paleyellow stubble of thespring buckwheat he wooded ravines and the copses which at the end ofugust had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble hadbecome golden and brightred islands amid the green winter rye hehares had already half changed their summer coats the fox cubs werebeginning to scatter and the young wolves were bigger than dogs t wasthe best time of the year for the chase he hounds of that ardent youngsportsman ostov had not merely reached hard winter condition but wereso jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them athree days rest and then on the sixteenth of eptember to go on adistant expedition starting from the oak grove where there was anundisturbed litter of wolf cubsll that day the hounds remained at home t was frosty and the air wassharp but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thawn the fifteenth when young ostov in his dressing gown looked out ofthe window he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting it wasas if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any windhe only motion in the air was that of the dripping microscopicparticles of drizzling mist he bare twigs in the garden were hung withtransparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves he earth inthe kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seedand at a short distance merged into the dull moist veil of misticholas went out into the wet and muddy porch here was a smell ofdecaying leaves and of dog ilka a blackspotted broadhaunched bitchwith prominent black eyes got up on seeing her master stretched herhind legs lay down like a hare and then suddenly jumped up and lickedhim right on his nose and mustache nother borzoi a dog catchingsight of his master from the garden path arched his back and rushingheadlong toward the porch with lifted tail began rubbing himselfagainst his legshoy came at that moment that inimitable huntsmans call whichunites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor and round the cornercame aniel the head huntsman and head kennelman a gray wrinkled oldman with hair cut straight over his forehead krainian fashion a longbent whip in his hand and that look of independence and scorn ofeverything that is only seen in huntsmen e doffed his ircassian capto his master and looked at him scornfully his scorn was not offensiveto his master icholas knew that this aniel disdainful of everybodyand who considered himself above them was all the same his serf andhuntsmananiel icholas said timidly conscious at the sight of the weatherthe hounds and the huntsman that he was being carried away by thatirresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his previousresolutions as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistresshat orders your excellency said the huntsman in his deep bass deepas a protodeacons and hoarse with hallooingand two flashing blackeyes gazed from under his brows at his master who was silent an youresist it those eyes seemed to be askingts a good day eh or a hunt and a gallop eh asked icholasscratching ilka behind the earsaniel did not answer but winked instead sent varka at dawn to listen his bass boomed out after a minutespause e says shes moved them into the tradnoe enclosure hey werehowling there his meant that the shewolf about whom they bothknew had moved with her cubs to the tradnoe copse a small place amile and a half from the housee ought to go dont you think so said icholas ome to me withvarkas you pleasehen put off feeding themes sirive minutes later aniel and varka were standing in icholas bigstudy hough aniel was not a big man to see him in a room was likeseeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture andsurroundings of human life aniel himself felt this and as usual stoodjust inside the door trying to speak softly and not move for fear ofbreaking something in the masters apartment and he hastened to say allthat was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling out into theopen under the sky once moreaving finished his inquiries and extorted from aniel an opinion thatthe hounds were fit aniel himself wished to go hunting icholasordered the horses to be saddled ut just as aniel was about to goatasha came in with rapid steps not having done up her hair orfinished dressing and with her old nurses big shawl wrapped round heretya ran in at the same timeou are going asked atasha  knew you would onya said youwouldnt go but  knew that today is the sort of day when you couldnthelp goinges we are going replied icholas reluctantly for today as heintended to hunt seriously he did not want to take atasha and

ichael must come with my dogs sheadded to the huntsmant seemed to aniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all but tohave anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible e castdown his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his businesscareful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the younglady he old count who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishmentbut had now handed it all completely over to his sons care being invery good spirits on this fifteenth of eptember prepared to go outwith the othersn an hours time the whole hunting party was at the porch

hewhispered straight to the yadov uplandshe count forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face looked intothe distance straight before him down the narrow open space holdingthe snuffbox in his hand but not taking any fter the cry of the houndscame the deep tones of the wolf call from aniels hunting horn thepack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full crywith that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after awolf he whippersin no longer set on the hounds but changed to thecry of ulyulyu and above the others rose aniels voice now a deepbass now piercingly shrill is voice seemed to fill the whole wood andcarried far beyond out into the open fieldfter listening a few moments in silence the count and his attendantconvinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs thesound of the larger pack eagerly giving tongue began to die away inthe distance the other pack rushed by the wood past the count and itwas with this that aniels voice was heard calling ulyulyu he soundsof both packs mingled and broke apart again but both were becoming moredistantimon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi hadentangled the count too sighed and noticing the snuffbox in his handopened it and took a pinch ack cried imon to a borzoi that waspushing forward out of the wood he count started and dropped thesnuffbox astasya vanovna dismounted to pick it up he count andimon were looking at himhen unexpectedly as often happens the sound of the hunt suddenlyapproached as if the hounds in full cry and aniel ulyulyuing were justin front of themhe count turned and saw on his right itka staring at him with eyesstarting out of his head raising his cap and pointing before him to theother sideook out he shouted in a voice plainly showing that he had longfretted to utter that word and letting the borzois slip he gallopedtoward the counthe count and imon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left awolf which softly swaying from side to side was coming at a quiet lopefarther to the left to the very place where they were standing heangry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past thehorses feet at the wolfhe wolf paused turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardlylike a man suffering from the quinsy and still slightly swaying fromside to side gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its taildisappeared into the skirt of the wood t the same instant with a crylike a wail first one hound then another and then another spranghelterskelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed acrossthe field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared he hazelbushes parted behind the hounds and aniels chestnut horse appeareddark with sweat n its long back sat aniel hunched

whip threateningly at the countouve let the wolf go hat sportsmen and as if scorning to saymore to the frightened and shamefaced count he lashed the heavingflanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count hadaroused and flew off after the hounds he count like a punishedschoolboy looked round trying by a smile to win imons sympathy forhis plight ut imon was no longer there e was galloping round by thebushes while the field was coming up on both sides all trying to headthe wolf but it vanished into the wood before they could do so icholas ostov meanwhile remained at his post waiting for the wolf ythe way the hunt approached and receded by the cries of the dogs whosenotes were familiar to him by the way the voices of the huntsmenapproached receded and rose he realized what was happening at thecopse e knew that young and old wolves were there that the hounds hadseparated into two packs that somewhere a wolf was being chased andthat something had gone wrong e expected the wolf to come his way anymoment e made thousands of different conjectures as to where and fromwhat side the beast would come and how he would set upon it opealternated with despair everal times he addressed a prayer to od thatthe wolf should come his way e prayed with that passionate andshamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitementarising from trivial causes hat would it be to hee to do this forme he said to od  know hou art great and that it is a sin to askthis of hee but for ods sake do let the old wolf come my way and letaray spring at itin sight of ncle who is watching from over thereand seize it by the throat in a death grip  thousand times duringthat halfhour ostov cast eager and restless glances over the edge ofthe wood with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowthand the gully with its waterworn side and ncles cap just visibleabove the bush on his righto  shant have such luck thought ostov yet what wouldnt it beworth t is not to be verywhere at cards and in war  am alwaysunlucky emories of usterlitz and of olokhov flashed rapidly andclearly through his mind nly once in my life to get an old wolf want only that thought he straining eyes and ears and looking to theleft and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation ofnote in the cries of the dogsgain he looked to the right and saw something running toward him acrossthe deserted field o it cant be thought ostov taking a deepbreath as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for heheight of happiness was reachedand so simply without warning ornoise or display that ostov could not believe his eyes and remainedin doubt for over a second he wolf ran forward and jumped heavily overa gully that lay in her path he was an old animal with a gray back andbig reddish belly he ran without hurry evidently feeling sure that noone saw her ostov holding his breath looked round at the borzoishey stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situationld aray had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleasbaring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legslyulyulyu whispered ostov pouting his lips he borzois jumped upjerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears aray finishedscratching his hindquarters and cocking his ears got up with quiveringtail from which tufts of matted hair hung downhall  loose them or not icholas asked himself as the wolfapproached him coming from the copse uddenly the wolfs wholephysiognomy changed she shuddered seeing what she had probably neverseen beforehuman eyes fixed upon herand turning her head a littletoward ostov she pausedack or forward h no matter forward the wolf seemed to say toherself and she moved forward without again looking round and with aquiet long easy yet resolute lopelyulyu cried icholas in a voice not his own and of its own accordhis good horse darted headlong downhill leaping over gullies to headoff the wolf and the borzois passed it running faster still icholasdid not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping nor see theborzois nor the ground over which he went he saw only the wolf whoincreasing her speed bounded on in the same direction along the hollowhe first to come into view was ilka with her black markings andpowerful quarters gaining upon the wolf earer and nearer now shewas ahead of it but the wolf turned its head to face her and insteadof putting on speed as she usually did ilka suddenly raised her tailand stiffened her forelegslyulyulyulyu shouted icholashe reddish yubim rushed forward from behind ilka sprang impetuouslyat the wolf and seized it by its hindquarters but immediately jumpedaside in terror he wolf crouched gnashed her teeth and again roseand bounded forward followed at the distance of a

beenstopped a second time by ncles borzoisaniel galloped up silently holding a naked dagger in his left hand andthrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as ifit were a

promised to return verysoon but as it was still early the hunt went farther t midday theyput the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young treesicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whipsacing him lay a field of winter rye there his own huntsman stood alonein a hollow behind a hazel bush he hounds had scarcely been loosedbefore icholas heard one he knew oltorn giving tongue at intervalsother hounds joined in now pausing and now again giving tongue moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had beenfound and the whole pack joining together rushed along the ravinetoward the ryefield and away from icholase saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of theravine he even saw the hounds and was expecting a fox to show itselfat any moment on the ryefield oppositehe huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois andicholas saw a queer shortlegged red fox with a fine brush going hardacross the field he borzois bore down on it ow they drew close tothe fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharpercurves trailing its brush when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashedin followed by a black one and everything was in confusion the borzoisformed a starshaped figure scarcely swaying their bodies and withtails turned away from the center of the group wo huntsmen galloped upto the dogs one in a red cap the other a stranger in a green coathats this thought icholas heres that huntsman from e is notncles manhe huntsmen got the fox but stayed there a long time without strappingit to the saddle heir horses bridled and with high saddles stoodnear them and there too the dogs were lying he huntsmen waved theirarms and did something to the fox hen from that spot came the sound ofa horn with the signal agreed on in case of a fighthats lagins huntsman having a row with our van said icholasgroomicholas sent the man to call atasha and etya to him and rode at afootpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds togethereveral of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going onicholas dismounted and with atasha and etya who had ridden upstopped near the hounds waiting to see how the matter would end ut ofthe bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward hisyoung master with the fox tied to his crupper hile still at adistance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully but he waspale and breathless and his face was angry ne of his eyes was blackbut he probably was not even aware of ithat has happened asked icholas likely thing killing a fox our dogs had hunted nd it was my graybitch that caught it o to law indeed e snatches at the fox gave him one with the fox ere it is on my saddle o you want a tasteof this said the huntsman pointing to his dagger and probablyimagining himself still speaking to his foeicholas not stopping to talk to the man asked his sister and etya towait for him and rode to the spot where the enemys lagins huntingparty washe victorious huntsman rode off to join the field and theresurrounded by inquiring sympathizers recounted his exploitshe facts were that lagin with whom the ostovs had a quarrel and wereat law hunted over places that belonged by custom to the ostovs andhad now as if purposely sent his men to the very woods the ostovswere hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chasedicholas though he had never seen lagin with his usual absence ofmoderation in judgment hated him cordially from reports of hisarbitrariness and violence and regarded him as his bitterest foe erode in angry agitation toward him firmly grasping his whip and fullyprepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish hisenemyardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in abeaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome ravenblack horseaccompanied by two hunt servantsnstead of an enemy icholas found in lagin a stately and courteousgentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young countsacquaintance aving ridden up to icholas lagin raised his beaver capand said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the manpunished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone elsesborzois e hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invitedhim to draw his covertatasha afraid that her brother would do something dreadful hadfollowed him in some excitement eeing the enemies exchanging friendlygreetings she rode up to them lagin lifted his beaver cap stillhigher to atasha and said with a pleasant smile that the youngcountess resembled iana in her passion for the chase as well as in herbeauty of which he had heard mucho expiate his huntsmans offense lagin pressed the ostovs to come toan upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself andwhich he said swarmed with hares icholas agreed and the hunt nowdoubled moved onhe way to ligins upland was across the fields he hunt servants fellinto line he masters rode

struck by the beauty of a small purebred redspotted bitch on lagins leash slender but with muscles like steel adelicate muzzle and prominent black eyes e had heard of the swiftnessof lagins borzois and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to his ownilkan the middle of a sober conversation begun by lagin about the yearsharvest icholas pointed to the redspotted bitch fine little bitch that said he

song and a valse then after a pause he clearedhis throat and sang his favorite hunting songs twas growing dark last night ell the snow so soft and lightncle sang as peasants sing with full and naive conviction that thewhole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes ofitself and that apart from the words there is no tune which existsonly to give measure to the words s a result of this the unconsideredtune like the song of a bird was extraordinarily good atasha was inecstasies over ncles singing he resolved to give up learning theharp and to play only the guitar he asked ncle for his guitar andat once found the chords of the songfter nine oclock two traps and three mounted men who had been sent tolook for them arrived to fetch atasha and etya he count andcountess did not know where they were and were very anxious said one ofthe menetya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the twotraps atasha and icholas got into the other ncle wrapped atashaup warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness eaccompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossedso that they had to go round by the ford and he sent huntsmen to ridein front

net trying not to believethat he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step andfeeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully andpatiently to disentangle them he countess with her loving heart feltthat her children were being ruined that it was not the counts faultfor he could not help being what he wasthat though he tried to hideit he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and hischildrens ruin and she tried to find means of remedying the positionrom her feminine point of view she could see only one solution namelyfor icholas to marry a rich heiress he felt this to be their lasthope and that if icholas refused the match she had found for him shewould have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters right his matchwas with ulie aragina the daughter of excellent and virtuous parentsa girl the ostovs had known from childhood and who had now become awealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothershe countess had written direct to ulies mother in oscow suggesting amarriage between their children and had received a favorable answer fromher aragina had replied that for her part she was agreeable andeverything depend on her

ulie to him and advised him to go to oscowduring the holidays to amuse himself icholas guessed what his mothersremarks were leading to and during one of these conversations inducedher to speak quite frankly he told him that her only hope of gettingtheir affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying ulie araginaut amma suppose  loved a girl who has no fortune would you expectme to sacrifice my

upwithout reason addressing her stiffly as my dear and using theformal you instead of the intimate thou in speaking to her hekindhearted countess was the more vexed with onya because that poordarkeyed

brighter more animated and prettierthan icholas had ever seen her beforeo thats what she is like what a fool  have been he thought gazingat her sparkling eyes and under the mustache a happy rapturous smiledimpled her cheeks a smile he had never seen beforem not afraid of anything said onya ay  go at once he gotuphey told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listenand they handed her a fur cloak he threw this over her head andshoulders and glanced at icholashat a darling that girl is thought he nd what have  beenthinking of till nowonya went out into the passage to go to the barn icholas went hastilyto the front porch saying he felt too hot he crowd of people reallyhad made the house stuffyutside there was the same cold stillness and the same moon but evenbrighter than before he light was so strong and the snow sparkled withso many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the realstars were unnoticed he sky was black and dreary while the earth wasgay am a fool a fool what have  been waiting for thought icholasand running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house andalong the path that led to the back porch e knew onya would pass thatway alfway lay some snowcovered piles of firewood and across andalong them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on thesnow and on the path his path led to the barn he log walls of thebarn and its snowcovered roof that looked as if hewn out of someprecious stone sparkled in the moonlight  tree in the garden snappedwith the frost and then all was again perfectly silent is bosomseemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladnessrom the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps thebottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heardthe voice of an old maidservant saying traight straight along thepath iss nly dont look back am not afraid answered onyas voice and along the path towardicholas came the crunching whistling sound of onyas feet in her thinshoesonya came along wrapped in her cloak he was only a couple of pacesaway when she saw him and to her too he was not the icholas she hadknown and always slightly feared e was in a womans dress withtousled hair and a happy smile new to onya he ran rapidly toward himuite different and yet the same thought icholas looking at herface all lit up by the

openeyed and motionless gazing at themoonlight through the frosty windowpanes oon after the hristmas holidays icholas told his mother of his lovefor onya and of his firm resolve to marry her he countess who hadlong noticed what was going on between them and was expecting thisdeclaration listened to him in silence and then told her son that hemight marry whom he pleased but that neither she nor his father wouldgive their blessing to such a marriage icholas for the first timefelt that his mother was displeased with him and that despite her lovefor him she would not give way oldly without looking at her son shesent for her husband and when he came tried briefly and coldly toinform him of the facts in her sons presence but unable to restrainherself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room he oldcount began irresolutely to admonish icholas and beg him to abandon hispurpose icholas replied that he could not go back on his word and hisfather sighing and evidently disconcerted very soon became silent andwent in to the countess n all his encounters with his son the countwas always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted thefamily fortune and so he could not be angry with him for refusing tomarry an heiress and choosing the dowerless onya n this occasion hewas only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had notbeen in disorder no better wife for icholas than onya could have beenwished for and that no one but himself with his itenka and hisuncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the familyfinanceshe father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son againbut a few days later the countess sent for onya and with a crueltyneither of them expected reproached her niece for trying to catchicholas and for ingratitude onya listened silently with downcast eyesto the countess cruel words without understanding what was required ofher he was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors elfsacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case she could not seewhat she ought to sacrifice or for whom he could not help loving thecountess and the whole ostov family but neither could she help lovingicholas and knowing that his happiness depended on that love he wassilent and sad and did not reply icholas felt the situation to beintolerable and went to have an explanation with his mother e firstimplored her to forgive him and onya and consent to their marriagethen he threatened that if she molested onya he would at once marry hersecretlyhe countess with a coldness her son had never seen in her beforereplied that he was of age that rince ndrew was marrying without hisfathers consent and he could do the same but that she would neverreceive that intriguer as her daughterxploding at the word intriguer icholas raising his voice told hismother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell hisfeelings but if that were so he would say for the last time ut hehad no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his facecaused his mother to await with terror and which would perhaps haveforever remained a cruel memory to them both e had not time to say itfor atasha with a pale and set face entered the room from the door atwhich she had been listeningicholas you are talking nonsense e quiet be quiet be quiet tell you she almost screamed so as to drown his voiceamma darling its not at all so my poor sweet darling she saidto her mother who conscious that they had been on the brink of arupture gazed at her son with terror but in the obstinacy andexcitement of the conflict could not and would not give wayicholas ll explain to you o away isten amma darling saidatashaer words were incoherent but they attained the purpose at which shewas aiminghe countess sobbing heavily hid her face on her daughters breastwhile icholas rose clutching his head and left the roomatasha set to work to effect a reconciliation and so far succeededthat icholas received a promise from his mother that onya should notbe troubled while he on his side promised not to undertake anythingwithout his parents knowledgeirmly resolved after putting his affairs

ofsenility by a tendency to fall asleep forgetfulness of quite recentevents remembrance of remote ones and the childish vanity with whichhe accepted the role of head of the oscow opposition n spite of thisthe old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectfulvenerationespecially of an evening when he came in to tea in his oldfashioned coat and powdered wig and aroused by anyone told

to show her that she was always to blame foreverything f late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented rincessary more than anything else this was his everincreasing intimacy withademoiselle

sayingulie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily though in amanner peculiar to herselfhe was twentyseven fter the death of her brothers she had becomevery wealthy he was by now decidedly plain but thought herself notmerely as goodlooking as before but even far more attractive he wasconfirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a verywealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the lessdangerous she became to men and the more freely they could associatewith her and avail themselves of her suppers soirees and the animatedcompany that assembled at her house without incurring any obligation man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day tothe house when there was a girl of seventeen there for fear ofcompromising her and

the gloomy old house on the ozdvizhenka and enteredthe vestibuleell the ord have mercy on us said the count half in jest half inearnest but atasha noticed that her father was flurried on enteringthe anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince andprincess were at homehen they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among theservants he footman who had gone to announce them was stopped byanother in the large hall and they whispered to one another hen amaidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something mentioningthe princess t last an old cross looking footman came and announcedto the ostovs that the prince was not receiving but that the princessbegged them to walk up he first person who came to meet the visitorswas ademoiselle ourienne he greeted the father and daughter withspecial politeness and showed them to the princess room he princesslooking excited and nervous her face flushed in patches ran in to meetthe visitors treading heavily and vainly trying to appear cordial andat ease rom the first glance rincess ary did not like atasha hethought her too fashionably dressed frivolously gay and vain he didnot at all realize that before having seen her future sisterinlaw shewas prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty youth andhappiness as well as by jealousy of her brothers love for her partfrom this insuperable antipathy to her rincess ary was agitated justthen because on the ostovs being announced the old prince had shoutedthat he did not wish to see them that rincess ary might do so if shechose but they were not to be admitted to him he had decided toreceive them but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge insome freak as he seemed much upset by the ostovs visithere my dear princess ve

then ll come backfor herhe count had devised this diplomatic ruse as he afterwards told hisdaughter to give the future sistersinlaw an opportunity to talk toone another freely but another motive was to avoid the danger ofencountering the old prince of whom he was afraid e did not mentionthis to his daughter but atasha noticed her fathers nervousness andanxiety and felt mortified by it he blushed for him grew stillangrier at having blushed and looked at the princess with a bold anddefiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody heprincess told the count that she would be delighted and only begged himto stay longer at nna emenovnas and he departedespite the uneasy glances thrown at her by rincess arywho wished tohave a ttette with atashaademoiselle ourienne remained in

princesswhoshe thoughtwas making a favor of receiving her and so everythingdispleased her he did not like rincess ary whom she thought veryplain affected and dry atasha suddenly shrank into herself andinvoluntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated rincess ary stillmore fter five minutes of irksome constrained conversation theyheard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching rincess

those shoulders and pearlsand coiffure and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearlshile atasha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the ladylooked round and meeting the counts eyes nodded to him and smiledhe was the ountess ezukhova ierres wife and the count who kneweveryone in society leaned over and spoke to herave you been here long ountess he inquired ll call ll callto kiss

the conductortapped with his stick ome latecomers took their seats in the stallsand the curtain roses soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent andall the men old and young in uniform and evening dress and all thewomen with gems on their bare flesh turned their whole attention witheager curiosity to the stage atasha too began to look at it he floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards at the sides was somepainted cardboard representing trees and at the back was a clothstretched over boards n the center of the stage sat some girls in redbodices and white skirts ne very fat girl in a white silk dress satapart on a low bench to the back of which a piece of green cardboardwas glued hey all sang something hen they had finished their songthe girl in white went up to the prompters box and a man with tightsilk trousers over his stout legs and holding a plume and a daggerwent up to her and began singing waving his arms aboutirst the man in the tight trousers sang alone then she sang then theyboth paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand ofthe girl in white obviously awaiting the beat to start singing withher hey sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping andshouting while the man and woman on the stagewho represented loversbegan smiling spreading out their arms and bowingfter her life in the country and in her present serious mood all thisseemed grotesque and amazing to atasha he could not follow the operanor even listen to the music she saw only the painted cardboard and thequeerly dressed men and women who moved spoke and sang so strangely inthat brilliant light he knew what it was all meant to represent butit was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamedfor the actors and then amused at them he looked at the faces of theaudience seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity sheherself experienced but they all seemed attentive to what was happeningon the stage and expressed delight which to atasha seemed feigned suppose it has to be like this she thought he kept looking round inturn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminudewomen in the boxes especially at elene in the next box whoapparently quite unclothedsat with a quiet tranquil smile not takingher eyes off the stage nd feeling the bright light that flooded thewhole place and the warm air heated by the crowd atasha little bylittle began to pass into a state of intoxication she had notexperienced for a long while he did not realize who and where she wasnor what was going on before her s she looked and thought thestrangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through hermind the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box andsinging the air the actress was singing then she wished to touch withher fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her then to lean over toelene and tickle hert a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song a doorleading to the stalls on the side nearest the ostovs box creaked andthe steps of a belated arrival were heard heres uragin whisperedhinshin ountess ezukhova turned smiling to the newcomer andatasha following the direction of that look saw an exceptionallyhandsome adjutant approaching their box with a selfassured yetcourteous bearing his was natole uragin whom she had seen andnoticed long ago at the ball in etersburg e was now in an adjutantsuniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot e moved with a restrainedswagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been so goodlookingand had his handsome face not worn such an expression of goodhumoredcomplacency and gaiety hough the performance was proceeding he walkeddeliberately down the carpeted gangway his sword and spurs slightlyjingling and his handsome perfumed head held high aving looked atatasha he approached his sister laid his well gloved hand on the edgeof her box nodded to her and leaning forward asked a question with amotion toward atashaais charmante said he evidently referring to atasha who did notexactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of hislips hen he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat downbeside olokhov nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand waythat olokhov whom others treated so fawningly e winked at him gailysmiled and rested his foot against the orchestra screenow like the brother is to the sister remarked the count nd howhandsome they both arehinshin lowering his voice began to tell the count of some intrigueof uragins in oscow and atasha tried to overhear it just because hehad said she was charmantehe first act was over n the stalls everyone began moving about goingout and coming inoris came to the ostovs box received their congratulations verysimply and raising his eyebrows with an absentminded smile conveyed toatasha and onya his fiancees invitation to her wedding and wentaway atasha with a gay coquettish smile talked to him andcongratulated on his approaching wedding that same oris with whom shehad formerly been in love n the state of intoxication she was ineverything seemed simple and naturalhe scantily clad elene smiled at everyone in the same way and atashagave oris a similar smileelenes box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the mostdistinguished and intellectual men who seemed to vie with one anotherin their wish to let everyone see that they knew heruring the whole of that entracte uragin stood with olokhov in frontof the orchestra partition looking at the ostovs box atasha knew hewas talking about her and this afforded her pleasure he even turned sothat he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becomingaspect efore the beginning of the second act ierre appeared in

began dragging away the maiden who had beenin white and was now in light blue hey did not drag her away at oncebut sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off andbehind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and everyoneknelt down and sang a prayer ll these things were repeatedlyinterrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audienceuring this act every time atasha

little head toward the elegant young officerand smiled at him over her bare shoulder natole who was as handsomeat close quarters as at a distance sat down beside her and told her hehad long wished to have this happinessever since the aryshkins ballin fact at which he had had the wellremembered pleasure of seeing heruragin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men etalked boldly and naturally and atasha was strangely and agreeablystruck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man aboutwhom there was so much talk but that on the contrary his smile was mostnaive cheerful and goodnatureduragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at aprevious performance emenova had fallen down on the stagend do you know ountess he said suddenly addressing her

never removed his smiling eyes from her face herneck and her bare arms atasha knew for certain that he was enrapturedby her his pleased her yet his presence made her feel constrained andoppressed hen she was not looking at him she felt that he was lookingat her shoulders and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he shouldlook into hers rather than this ut looking into his eyes she wasfrightened realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she hadalways felt between herself and other men he did not know how it wasthat within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near tothis man hen she turned away she feared he might seize her from behindby her bare arm and kiss her on the neck hey spoke of most ordinarythings yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she hadever been to any man atasha kept turning to elene and to her fatheras if asking what it all meant but elene was engaged in conversationwith a general and did not answer her look and her fathers eyes saidnothing but what they always said aving a good time ell m gladof ituring one of these moments of awkward silence when natoles prominenteyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her atasha to break thesilence asked him how he liked oscow he asked the question andblushed he felt all the time that by talking to him she was doingsomething improper natole smiled as though to encourage hert

tournament ountess o come and putting out his hand to herbouquet and dropping his voice he added ou will be the prettiestthere o come dear countess and give me this flower as a pledge re the pretty womenatasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he didhimself but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improperintention he did not know what to say and turned away as if she hadnot heard his remark ut as soon as she had turned away she felt thathe was there behind so close behind herow is he now onfused ngry ught  to put it right she askedherself and she could not refrain from turning round he lookedstraight into his eyes and his nearness selfassurance and the goodnatured tenderness of his smile vanquished her he smiled just as hewas doing gazing straight into his eyes nd again she felt with horrorthat no barrier lay between him and herhe curtain rose again natole left the box serene and gay atashawent back to her father in the other box now quite submissive to theworld she found herself in ll that was going on before her now seemedquite natural but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of herbetrothed of rincess ary or of life in the country did not oncerecur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote pastn the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his armabout till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeareddown below hat was the only part of the fourth act that atasha sawhe felt agitated and tormented and the cause of this was uragin whomshe could not help watching s they were leaving the theater natolecame up to them called their carriage and helped them in s he wasputting atasha in he pressed her arm above the elbow gitated andflushed she turned round e was looking at her with glittering eyessmiling tenderlynly after she had reached home was atasha able clearly to think overwhat had happened to her and suddenly remembering rince ndrew she washorrified and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera shegave a loud exclamation flushed and ran out of the room od  am lost she said to herself ow could  let him he satfor a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realizewhat had happened to her but was unable either to understand what hadhappened or what she felt verything seemed dark obscure andterrible here in that enormous illuminated theater where the barelegged uport in a tinseldecorated jacket jumped about to the musicon wet boards and young girls and old men and the nearly naked elenewith her proud calm smile rapturously cried bravothere in thepresence of that elene it had all seemed clear and simple but nowalone by herself it was incomprehensible hat is it hat was thatterror  felt of him hat is this gnawing of conscience  am feelingnow she thoughtnly to the old countess at night in bed could atasha have told all shewas feeling he knew that onya with her severe and simple views wouldeither not understand it at all or would be horrified at such aconfession o atasha tried to solve what was torturing her by herselfm  spoiled for ndrews love or not she asked herself and withsoothing irony replied hat a fool  am to ask that hat did happento me othing  have done nothing  didnt lead him on at all obodywill know and  shall never see him again she told herself o it isplain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of andndrew can love me still ut why still  od why isnt he hereatasha quieted herself for a moment but again some instinct told herthat though all this was true and though nothing had happened yet theformer purity of her love for rince ndrew had perished nd again inimagination she went over her whole conversation with uragin and againsaw the face gestures and tender smile of that bold handsome man whenhe pressed her arm natole uragin was staying in oscow because his father had sent himaway from etersburg where he had been spending twenty thousand rublesa year in cash besides

fond of olokhov for his cleverness and audacityolokhov who needed natole uragins name position and connectionsas a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set made use of himand amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel itpart from the advantage he derived from natole the very process ofdominating anothers will was in itself a pleasure a habit and anecessity to

again presented itself whether she was not guilty whether shehad not already broken faith with rince ndrew and again she foundherself recalling to the minutest detail every word every gesture andevery

could not see atashaierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip aboutthe attempted abduction of ostova e resolutely denied these rumorsassuring everyone that nothing had happened

tounderstand his aims o judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw onhim all the blame of other mens mistakes is very easy but  maintainthat if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done byhim by him alonee paused at the sight of ierre is face quivered and immediatelyassumed a vindictive expressionosterity will do him justice he concluded and at once turned toierreell how are

toofamiliar to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous mattersin order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimatehen rince eshcherski had left rince ndrew took ierres arm andasked him into the room that had been assigned him  bed had been madeup there and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about rincendrew went to one and took out a small casket from which he drew

stepping up to him stopped breathing heavily her armshanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she wentto the middle of the ballroom to sing but with quite a differentexpression of

thesleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleighhere to now your excellency asked the coachmanhere to ierre asked himself here can  go now urely not to theclub or to pay calls ll men

entrance to the rbat quare an immense expanse of dark starrysky presented itself to his eyes lmost in the center of it above therechistenka oulevard surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by starsbut distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth its whitelight and its long uplifted tail shone the enormous and brilliantcomet of the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes andthe end of the world n ierre however that comet with its longluminous tail aroused no feeling of fear n the contrary he gazedjoyfully his eyes moist with tears at this bright comet which havingtraveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurablespace seemed suddenlylike an arrow piercing the earthto remainfixed in a chosen spot vigorously holding its tail erect shining anddisplaying

the close of the year  intensified arming and concentrating ofthe forces of estern urope began and in  these forcesmillionsof men reckoning those transporting and feeding the armymoved fromthe west eastwards to the ussian frontier toward which since ussian forces had been similarly drawn n the twelfth of une the forces of estern urope crossed the ussian frontier and war beganthat is an event took place opposed to human reason and to humannature illions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerablecrimes frauds treacheries thefts forgeries issues of false moneyburglaries incendiarisms and murders as in whole centuries are notrecorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world but whichthose who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimeshat produced this extraordinary occurrence hat were its causes hehistorians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the wrongsinflicted on the uke of ldenburg the nonobservance of the ontinentalystem the ambition of apoleon the firmness of lexander themistakes of the diplomatists and so ononsequently it would only have been necessary for etternichumyantsev or alleyrand between a levee and an evening party to havetaken proper pains and written a more adroit note or for apoleon tohave written to lexander y respected rother  consent to restorethe duchy to the uke of ldenburgand there would have been no ware can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries tnaturally seemed to apoleon that the war was caused by nglandsintrigues as in fact he said on the island of t elena t naturallyseemed to members of the nglish arliament that the cause of the warwas apoleons ambition to the uke of ldenburg that the cause of thewar was the violence done to him to businessmen that the cause of thewar was the ontinental ystem which was ruining urope to the generalsand old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity ofgiving them employment to the legitimists of that day that it was theneed of reestablishing les bons principes and to the diplomatists ofthat time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance betweenussia and ustria in  had not been sufficiently well concealed fromapoleon and from the awkward wording of emorandum o  t isnatural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of otherreasons the number depending on the endless diversity of points ofview presented themselves to the men of that day but to us toposterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude andperceive its plain and terrible meaning these causes seem insufficiento us it is incomprehensible that millions of hristian men killed andtortured each other either because apoleon was ambitious or lexanderwas firm or because nglands policy was astute or the uke ofldenburg wronged e cannot grasp what connection such circumstanceshave with the actual fact of slaughter and violence why because theuke was wronged thousands of men from the other side of urope killedand ruined the people of molensk and oscow and were killed by themo us their descendants who are not historians and are not carriedaway by the process of research and can therefore regard the event withunclouded common sense an incalculable number of causes presentthemselves he deeper we delve in search of these causes the more ofthem we find and each separate cause or whole series of causes appearsto us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificancecompared to the magnitude of the events and by its impotenceapartfrom the cooperation of all the other coincident causesto occasion theevent o us the wish or objection of this or that rench corporal toserve a second term appears as much a cause as apoleons refusal towithdraw his troops beyond the istula and to restore the duchy ofldenburg for had he not wished to serve and had a second a thirdand a thousandth corporal and private also refused there would havebeen so many less men in apoleons army and the war could not haveoccurredad apoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdrawbeyond the istula and not ordered his troops to advance there wouldhave been no war but had all his sergeants objected to serving a secondterm then also there could have been no war or could there have been awar had there been no nglish intrigues and no uke of ldenburg andhad lexander not felt insulted and had there not been an autocraticgovernment in ussia or a evolution in rance and a subsequentdictatorship and mpire or all the things that produced the renchevolution and so on ithout each of these causes nothing could havehappened o all these causesmyriads of causescoincided to bring itabout nd so there was no one cause for that occurrence but it had tooccur because it had to illions of men renouncing their humanfeelings and reason had to go from west to east to slay their fellowsjust as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the eastto the west slaying their fellowshe actions of apoleon and lexander on whose words the event seemedto hang were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who wasdrawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription his could not beotherwise for in order that the will of apoleon and lexander on whomthe event seemed to depend should be carried out the concurrence ofinnumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the eventcould not have taken place t was necessary that millions of men inwhose hands lay the real powerthe soldiers who fired or transportedprovisions and gunsshould consent to carry out the will of these weakindividuals and should have been induced to do so by an infinite numberof diverse and complex causese are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrationalevents that is to say events the reasonableness of which we do notunderstand he more we try to explain such events in historyreasonably the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become tousach man lives for himself using his freedom to attain his personalaims and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain fromdoing this or that action but as soon as he has done it that actionperformed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs tohistory in which it has not a free but a predestined significancehere are two sides to the life of every man his individual life whichis the more free the more abstract its interests and his elemental hivelife in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for himan lives consciously for himself but is an unconscious instrument inthe attainment of the historic universal aims of humanity  deed doneis irrevocable and its result coinciding in time with the actions

thepredestination and inevitability of his every actionhe kings heart is in the hands of the ord king is historys slaveistory that is the unconscious general hive life of mankind usesevery moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposeshough apoleon at that time in  was more convinced than ever thatit depended on him verser ou ne pas verser le sang de ses peuples as lexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote himhe had neverbeen so much in the grip of inevitable laws which compelled him whilethinking that he was acting on his own volition to perform for the hivelifethat is to

deafened continually by incessant and rapturousacclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossibleto forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shoutingbut the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him anddistracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from thetime he joined the army e rode across one of the swaying pontoonbridges

handsome old man flushed and fumbling in his speechfrom excitement asked the aidedecamp whether he would be permitted toswim the river with his uhlans instead of seeking a ford n evidentfear of refusal like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse hebegged to be allowed to swim across the river before the mperors eyeshe aidedecamp replied that probably the mperor would not bedispleased at this excess of zeals soon as the aidedecamp had said this the old mustached officerwith happy face and sparkling eyes raised his saber shouted ivatand commanding the uhlans to follow him spurred his horse and gallopedinto the river e gave an angry thrust to his horse which had grownrestive under him and plunged into the water heading for the deepestpart where the current was swift undreds of uhlans galloped in afterhim t was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of thestream and the uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off theirhorses ome of the horses were drowned

returned and choosing an opportune momentventured to draw the mperors attention to the devotion of the oles tohis person the little man in the gray overcoat got up and havingsummoned erthier began

became generally knownand the dignity of rance was thereby offended oyalty has its obligationsalashev replied that there was nothing offensive in the demandbecause but urat interrupted himhen you dont

wellood day eneral said he  have received the letter you broughtfrom the mperor lexander and am very glad to see you e glanced withhis large eyes into alashavs face and immediately looked past himt was plain that alashevs personality did not interest him at allvidently only what took place within his own mind interested himothing outside himself had any significance for him because everythingin the world it seemed to him depended entirely on his will do not and did not desire war he continued but it has beenforced on me ven now he emphasized the word  am ready to receiveany explanations you can give mend he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons fordissatisfaction with the ussian government udging by the calmlymoderate and amicable tone in which the rench mperor spoke alashevwas firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter intonegotiationshen apoleon having finished speaking looked inquiringly at theussian envoy alashev began a speech he had prepared long beforeire he mperor my master but the sight of the mperors eyesbent on him confused him ou are flurriedcompose yourself apoleonseemed to say as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked atalashevs uniform and swordalashev recovered himself and began to speak e said that the mperorlexander did not consider urakins demand for his passports asufficient cause for war that urakin had acted on his own initiativeand without his sovereigns assent that the mperor lexander did notdesire war and had no relations with nglandot yet interposed apoleon and as if fearing to give vent to hisfeelings he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that alashev mightproceedfter saying all he had been instructed to say alashev added that themperor lexander wished for peace but would not enter intonegotiations except on condition that ere alashev hesitated heremembered the words the mperor lexander had not written in hisletter but had specially inserted in the rescript to altykov and hadtold alashev to repeat to apoleon alashev remembered these wordso long as a single armed foe remains on ussian soil but somecomplex feeling restrained him e could not utter them though hewished to do so e grew confused and said n condition that therench army retires beyond the iemenapoleon noticed alashevs embarrassment when uttering these lastwords his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiverrhythmically ithout moving from where he stood he began speaking in alouder tone and more hurriedly than before uring the speech thatfollowed alashev who more than once lowered his

straight atalashevhe latter bowed his head respectfullynstead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from omeraniaonly a withdrawal beyond the iemen was now demanded apoleon turnedquickly and began to pace the roomou say the demand now is that  am to withdraw beyond the iemenbefore commencing negotiations but in just the same way two months agothe demand was that  should withdraw

and oscow  could not acceptsuch conditions ou say  have begun this war ut who first joined hisarmy he mperor lexander not  nd you offer me negotiations when have expended millions when you are in alliance with ngland and whenyour position is a bad one ou offer me negotiations ut what is theaim of your alliance with ngland hat has she given you he continuedhurriedly evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peaceand discuss its possibility but only to prove his own rectitude andpower and lexanders errors and duplicityhe commencement of his speech had obviously been made with theintention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showingthat he was nevertheless willing to negotiate ut he had begun talkingand the more he talked the less could he control his wordshe whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself andinsult lexanderjust what he had least desired at the commencement ofthe interview hear you have made peace with urkeyalashev bowed his head affirmativelyeace has been concluded he beganut apoleon did not let him speak e evidently wanted to do all thetalking himself and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence andunrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so pronees  know you have made peace with the urks without obtainingoldavia and allachia  would have given your sovereign thoseprovinces as  gave him inland es he went on  promised and wouldhave given the mperor lexander oldavia and allachia and now hewont have those splendid provinces et he might have united them tohis empire and in a single reign would have extended ussia from theulf of othnia to the mouths of the anube atherine the reat couldnot have done more said apoleon growing more and more excited as hepaced up and down the room repeating to alashev almost the very wordshe had used to lexander himself at ilsit ll that he would haveowed to my friendship h what a splendid reign he repeated severaltimes then paused drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox lifted it tohis nose and greedily sniffed at ithat a splendid reign the mperor lexanders might have beene looked compassionately at alashev and as soon as the latter triedto make some rejoinder hastily interrupted himhat could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained throughmy friendship demanded apoleon shrugging his shoulders inperplexity ut no he has preferred to surround himself with myenemies and with whom ith teins rmfeldts ennigsens andintzingerodes tein a traitor expelled from his own countryrmfeldt a rake and an intriguer intzingerode a fugitive renchsubject ennigsen rather more of a soldier than the others but allthe same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in  and whoshould awaken terrible memories in the mperor lexanders mindranted that were they competent they might be made use of continuedapoleonhardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughtsthat incessantly sprang up proving how right and strong he was in hisperception the two were one and the samebut they are not even thathey are neither fit for war nor peace arclay is said to be the mostcapable of them all but  cannot say so judging by his firstmovements nd what are they doing all these courtiers fuel proposesrmfeldt disputes ennigsen considers and arclay called on to actdoes not know what to decide on and time passes bringing no resultagration alone is a military man es stupid but he has experience aquick eye and resolution nd what role is your young monarchplaying in that monstrous crowd hey compromise him and throw on himthe responsibility for all that happens  sovereign should not be withthe army unless he is a general said apoleon evidently utteringthese words as a direct challenge to the mperor e knew how lexanderdesired to be a military commanderhe campaign began only a week ago and you havent even been able todefend ilna ou are cut in two and have been driven out of the olishprovinces our army is grumblingn the contrary our ajesty said alashev hardly able to rememberwhat had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks withdifficulty the troops are burning with eagerness know everything apoleon interrupted him  know everything know the number of your battalions as exactly as  know my own ou havenot two hundred thousand men and  have three times that number  giveyou my word of honor said apoleon forgetting that his word of honorcould carry no weight give you my word of honor that  have fivehundred and thirty thousand men this side of the istula he urks willbe of no use to you they are worth nothing and have shown it by makingpeace with you s for the wedesit is their fate to be governed bymad kings heir king was insane and they changed him for anotherernadotte who promptly went madfor no wede would ally himself withussia unless he were madapoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nosealashev knew how to reply to each of apoleons remarks and would havedone so he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to saysomething but apoleon always interrupted him o the alleged insanityof the wedes alashev wished to reply that when ussia is on her sideweden is practically an island but apoleon gave an angry exclamationto drown his voice apoleon was in that state of irritability in whicha man has to talk talk and talk merely to convince himself that he isin the right alashev began to feel uncomfortable as envoy he fearedto demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying but as a manhe shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidentlyseized apoleon e knew that none of the words now uttered by apoleonhad any significance and that apoleon himself would be ashamed of themwhen he came to his senses alashev stood with downcast eyes lookingat the movements of apoleons stout legs and trying to avoid meetinghis eyesut what do  care about your allies said apoleon  have alliesthe oles here are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lionsnd there will be two hundred thousand of themnd probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered thisobvious falsehood and that alashev still stood silently before him inthe same attitude of submission to fate apoleon abruptly turned rounddrew close to alashevs face and gesticulating rapidly andenergetically with his white hands almost shoutednow that if you stir up russia against me ll wipe it off the mapof urope he declared his face pale and distorted by anger and hestruck one of his small hands energetically with the other es  willthrow you back beyond the vina and beyond the nieper and will reerect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of uropeto allow to be destroyed es that is what will happen to you hat iswhat you have gained by alienating me nd he walked silently severaltimes up and down the room his fat shoulders twitchinge put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket took it out again liftedit several times to his nose and stopped in front of alashev epaused looked ironically straight into alashevs eyes and said in aquiet voicend yet what a splendid reign your master might have hadalashev feeling it incumbent on him to reply said that from theussian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light apoleon wassilent still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening tohim alashev said that in ussia the best results were expected fromthe war apoleon nodded condescendingly as if to say  know itsyour duty to say that but you dont believe it yourself  haveconvinced youhen alashev had ended apoleon again took out his snuffbox sniffedat it and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal he dooropened a gentlemaninwaiting bending respectfully handed the mperorhis hat and gloves another brought him a pocket handkerchief apoleonwithout giving them a glance turned to alashevssure the mperor lexander from me said he taking his hat that am as devoted to him as before  know him thoroughly and very highlyesteem his lofty qualities  will detain you no longer eneral youshall receive my letter to the mperornd apoleon went quickly to the door veryone in the reception roomrushed forward and descended the staircase fter all that apoleon had said to himthose bursts of anger and thelast dryly spoken words  will detain you no longer eneral youshall receive my letter alashev felt convinced that apoleon wouldnot wish to see him and would even avoid another meeting with himaninsulted envoyespecially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger utto his surprise alashev received through uroc an invitation to dinewith the mperor that dayessieres aulaincourt and erthier were present at that dinnerapoleon met alashev cheerfully and amiably e not only showed no signof constraint or selfreproach on account of his outburst that morningbut on the contrary tried to reassure alashev t was evident that hehad long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make amistake and that in his perception whatever he did was right notbecause it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong but because hedid ithe mperor was in very good spirits after his ride through ilna wherecrowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him rom all thewindows of the streets through which he rode rugs flags and hismonogram were displayed and the olish ladies welcoming him wavedtheir handkerchiefs to himt dinner having placed alashev beside him apoleon not only treatedhim amiably but behaved as if alashev were one of his own courtiersone of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at hissuccess n the course of conversation he mentioned oscow andquestioned alashev about the ussian capital not merely as aninterested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit but as ifconvinced that alashev as a ussian must be flattered by hiscuriosityow many inhabitants are there in oscow ow many houses s it truethat oscow is called oly oscow ow many churches are there inoscow he askednd receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churcheshe remarkedhy such a quantity of churcheshe ussians are very devout replied alashevut a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of thebackwardness of a people said apoleon turning to aulaincourt forappreciation of this remarkalashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the rench mperorvery country has its own character said heut nowhere in urope is there anything like that said apoleon beg your ajestys pardon returned alashev besides ussia thereis pain where there are also many churches and monasterieshis reply of alashevs which hinted at the recent defeats of therench in pain was much appreciated when he related it at lexanderscourt but it was not much appreciated at apoleons dinner where itpassed unnoticedhe uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that theywere puzzled as to what alashevs tone suggested f there is a pointwe dont see it or it is not at all witty their expressions seemed tosay o little was his rejoinder appreciated that apoleon did notnotice it at all and naively asked alashev through what towns thedirect road from there to oscow passed alashev who was on the alertall through the dinner replied that just as all roads lead to omeso all roads lead to oscow there were many roads and among them theroad through oltava which harles  chose alashev involuntarilyflushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply but hardly had heuttered the word oltava before aulaincourt began speaking of thebadness of the road from etersburg to oscow and of his etersburgreminiscencesfter dinner they went to drink coffee in apoleons study which fourdays previously had been that of the mperor lexander apoleon satdown toying with his evres coffee cup and motioned alashev to achair beside himapoleon was in that wellknown afterdinner mood which more than anyreasoned cause makes a man contented with himself and disposed toconsider everyone his friend t seemed to him that he was surrounded bymen who adored him and he felt convinced that after his dinneralashev too was his friend and worshiper apoleon turned to him with apleasant though slightly ironic smilehey tell me this is the room the mperor lexander occupied trangeisnt it eneral he said evidently not doubting that this remarkwould be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his apoleonssuperiority to lexanderalashev made no reply and bowed his head in silencees our days ago in this room intzingerode and tein weredeliberating continued apoleon with the same derisive and selfconfident smile hat  cant understand he went on is that themperor lexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies hat do not understand as he not thought that  may do the same andhe turned inquiringly to alashev and evidently this thought turned himback on to the track of his mornings anger which was still fresh inhimnd let him know that  will do so said apoleon rising and pushinghis cup away with his hand ll drive all his urttemberg aden andeimar relations out of ermany es ll drive them out et himprepare an asylum for them in ussiaalashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like tomake his bow and leave and only listened because he could not helphearing what was said to him apoleon did not notice this expressionhe treated alashev not as an envoy from his enemy but as a man nowfully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former mastershumiliationnd why has the mperor lexander taken command of the armies hat isthe good of that ar is my profession but his business is to reign andnot to command armies hy has he taken on himself such aresponsibilitygain apoleon brought out his snuffbox paced several times up and downthe room in silence and then suddenly and unexpectedly went up toalashev and with a slight smile as confidently quickly and simply asif he were doing something not merely important but pleasing toalashev he raised his hand to the fortyyearold ussian generalsface and taking him by the ear pulled it gently smiling with his lipsonlyo have ones ear pulled by the mperor was considered the greatesthonor and mark of favor at the rench courtell adorer and courtier of the mperor lexander why dont you sayanything said he as if it was ridiculous in his presence to be theadorer and courtier of anyone but himself apoleon re the horsesready for the general he added with a slight inclination of his headin reply to alashevs bow et him have mine he has a long way togohe letter taken by alashev was the last apoleon sent to lexandervery detail of the interview was communicated to the ussian monarchand the war began fter his interview with ierre in oscow rince ndrew went toetersburg on business as he told his family but really to meetnatole uragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter n reachingetersburg he inquired for uragin but the latter had already left thecity ierre had warned his brotherinlaw that rince ndrew was on histrack natole uragin promptly obtained an appointment from theinister of ar and went to join the army in oldavia hile inetersburg rince ndrew met utuzov his former commander who wasalways well disposed toward him and utuzov suggested that he shouldaccompany him to the army in oldavia to which the old general had beenappointed commanderinchief o rince ndrew having received anappointment on the headquarters staff left for urkeyrince ndrew did not think it proper to write and challenge uragin ethought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it mightcompromise the young ountess ostova and so he wanted to meet uraginpersonally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel ut he againfailed to meet uragin in urkey for soon after rince ndrew arrivedthe latter returned to ussia n a new country amid new conditionsrince ndrew found life easier to bear fter his betrothed had brokenfaith with himwhich he felt the more acutely the more he tried toconceal its effectsthe surroundings in which he had been happy becametrying to him and the freedom and independence he had once prized sohighly were still more so ot only could he no longer think thethoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on thefield of usterlitz and had later enlarged upon with ierre and whichhad filled his solitude at ogucharovo and then in witzerland and omebut he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizonsthey had revealed e was now concerned only with the nearest practicalmatters unrelated to his past interests and he seized on these the moreeagerly the more those past interests were closed to him t was as ifthat lofty infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above himhad suddenly turned into a low solid vault that weighed him down inwhich all was clear but nothing eternal or mysteriousf the activities that presented themselves to him army service was thesimplest and most familiar s a general on duty on utuzovs staff heapplied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprisedutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work ot having founduragin in urkey rince ndrew did not think it necessary to rush backto ussia after him but all the same he knew that however long it mightbe before he met uragin despite his contempt for him and despite allthe proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stoopingto a conflict with himhe knew that when he did meet him he would notbe able to resist calling him out any more than a ravenous man can helpsnatching at food nd the consciousness that the insult was not yetavenged that his rancor was still unspent weighed on his heart andpoisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain inurkey by means of restless plodding and rather vainglorious andambitious activityn the year  when news of the war with apoleon reached ucharestwhere utuzov had been living for two months passing his days andnights with a allachian womanrince ndrew asked utuzov to transferhim to the estern rmy utuzov who was already weary of olkonskisactivity which seemed to reproach his own idleness very readily let himgo and gave him a mission to arclay de ollyefore joining the estern rmy which was then in ay encamped atrissa rince ndrew visited ald ills which was directly on his waybeing only two miles off the molensk highroad uring the last threeyears there had been so many changes in his life he had thought feltand seen so much having traveled both in the east and the west thaton reaching ald ills it struck him as strange and unexpected to findthe way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail eentered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up theavenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchantedsleeping castle he same old stateliness the same cleanliness thesame stillness reigned there and inside there was the same furniturethe same walls sounds and smell and the same timid faces onlysomewhat older rincess ary was still the same timid plain maidengetting on in years uselessly and joylessly passing the best years ofher life in fear and constant suffering ademoiselle ourienne was thesame coquettish selfsatisfied girl enjoying every moment of herexistence and full of joyous hopes for the future he had merely becomemore selfconfident rince ndrew thought essalles the tutor he hadbrought from witzerland was wearing a coat of ussian cut and talkingbroken ussian to the servants but was still the same narrowlyintelligent conscientious and pedantic preceptor he old prince hadchanged in appearance only by the loss of a tooth which left anoticeable gap on one side of his mouth in character he was the same asever only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what washappening in the world ittle icholas alone had changed e had grownbecome rosier had curly dark hair and when merry and laughing quiteunconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just asthe little princess used to do e alone did not obey the law ofimmutability in the enchanted sleeping castle ut though externallyall remained as of old the inner relations of all these people hadchanged since rince ndrew had seen them last he household wasdivided into two alien and hostile camps who changed their habits forhis sake and only met because he was there o the one camp belonged theold prince ademoiselle ourienne and the architect to the otherrincess ary essalles little icholas and all the old nurses andmaidsuring his stay at ald ills all the family dined together but theywere ill at ease and rince ndrew felt that he was a visitor for whosesake an exception was being made and that his presence made them allfeel awkward nvoluntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day hewas taciturn and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumband retired to his apartments directly after dinner n the eveningwhen rince ndrew went to him and trying to rouse him began to tellhim of the young ount amenskys campaign the old prince beganunexpectedly to talk about rincess ary blaming her for hersuperstitions and her dislike of ademoiselle ourienne who he saidwas the only person really attached to himhe old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of rincessary that she purposely worried and irritated him and that byindulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little rince icholas heold prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that herlife was very hard but he also knew that he could not help tormentingher and that she deserved it hy does rince ndrew who sees thissay nothing to me about his sister oes he think me a scoundrel or anold fool who without any reason keeps his own daughter at a distanceand attaches this renchwoman to himself e doesnt understand so must explain it and he must hear me out thought the old prince ndhe began explaining why he could not put up with his daughtersunreasonable characterf you ask me said rince ndrew without looking up he wascensuring his father for the first time in his life  did not wish tospeak about it but as you ask me  will give you my frank opinion fthere is any misunderstanding and discord between you and ary  cantblame her for it at all  know how she loves and respects you inceyou ask me continued rince ndrew becoming irritableas he wasalways liable to do of late can only say that if there are anymisunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman who is notfit to be my sisters companionhe old man at first stared fixedly at his son and an unnatural smiledisclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which rince ndrew couldnot get accustomedhat companion my dear boy h ouve already been talking it overhather  did not want to judge said rince ndrew in a hard andbitter tone but you challenged me and  have said and always shallsay that ary is not to blame but those to blamethe one to blameisthat renchwomanh he has passed judgment passed judgement said the old man in alow voice and as it seemed to rince ndrew with some embarrassmentbut then he suddenly jumped up and cried e off be off et not atrace of you remain hererince ndrew wished to leave at once but rincess ary persuaded himto stay another day hat day he did not see his father who did notleave his room and admitted no one but ademoiselle ourienne andikhon but asked several times whether his son had gone ext daybefore leaving rince ndrew went to his sons rooms he boy curlyheaded like his mother and glowing with health sat on his knee andrince ndrew began telling him the story of luebeard but fell into areverie without finishing the story e thought not of this prettychild his son whom he held on his knee but of himself e sought inhimself either remorse for having angered his father or regret atleaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him andwas horrified to find neither hat meant still more to him was that hesought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his sonwhich he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him onhis kneeell go on said his sonrince ndrew without replying put him down from his knee and went outof the rooms soon as rince ndrew had given up his daily occupations andespecially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he hadbeen happy weariness of life overcame him with its former intensityand he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work assoon as possibleo youve decided to go ndrew asked his sisterhank od that  can replied rince ndrew  am very sorry

speak of that her lips trembled and her tearsbegan to fall rince ndrew turned away and began pacing the roomh my od my od hen one thinks who and whatwhat trashcan causepeople misery he said with a malignity that alarmed rincess aryhe understood that when speaking of trash he referred not only toademoiselle ourienne the cause of her misery but also to the man whohad ruined his own happinessndrew ne thing  beg  entreat of you she said touching hiselbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears understand you she looked down ont imagine that sorrow is thework of men en are is

already persuading me to forgive it means that  ought longago to have punished him he thought nd giving her no further replyhe began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meeturagin who he knew was now in the armyrincess ary begged him to stay one day more saying that she knew howunhappy her father would be if ndrew left without being reconciled tohim but rince ndrew replied that he would probably soon be back againfrom the army and would certainly write to his father but that thelonger he stayed now the more embittered their differences would becomeoodbye ndrew emember that misfortunes come from od and men arenever to blame were the last words he heard from his sister when hetook leave of herhen it must be so thought rince ndrew as he drove out of theavenue from the house at ald ills he poor innocent creature isleft to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits he oldman feels he is guilty but cannot change himself y boy is growing upand rejoices in life in which like everybody else he will deceive or bedeceived nd  am off to the army hy  myself dont know  want tomeet that man whom  despise so as to give him a chance to kill andlaugh at mehese conditions of life had been the same before but then they wereall connected while now they had all tumbled to pieces nly senselessthings lacking coherence presented themselves one after another torince ndrews mind rince ndrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end ofune he first army with which was the mperor occupied the fortifiedcamp at rissa the second army was retreating trying to effect ajunction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off bylarge rench forces veryone was dissatisfied with the general courseof affairs in the ussian army but no one anticipated any danger ofinvasion of the ussian provinces and no one thought the war wouldextend farther than the western the olish provincesrince ndrew found arclay de olly to whom he had been assigned onthe bank of the rissa s there was not a single town or large villagein the vicinity of the camp the immense number of generals andcourtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of thevillages on both sides of the river over a radius of six miles arclayde olly was quartered nearly three miles from the mperor e receivedolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that hewould mention him to the mperor for a decision as to his employmentbut asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff natole uragin whomrince ndrew had hoped to find with the army was not there e hadgone to etersburg but rince ndrew was glad to hear this is mindwas occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting agigantic war and he was glad to be free for a while from thedistraction caused by the thought of uragin uring the first fourdays while no duties were required of him rince ndrew rode round thewhole fortified camp and by the aid of his own knowledge and by talkswith experts tried to form a definite opinion about it ut thequestion whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remainedfor him undecided lready from his military experience and what he hadseen in the ustrian campaign he had come to the conclusion that in warthe most deeply considered plans have no significance and that alldepends on the way unexpected movements of the enemythat cannot beforeseenare met and on how and by whom the whole matter is handledo clear up this last point for himself rince ndrew utilizing hisposition and acquaintances tried to fathom the character of the controlof the army and of the men and parties engaged in it and he deduced forhimself the following of the state of affairshile the mperor had still been at ilna the forces had been dividedinto three armies irst the army under arclay de olly secondly thearmy under agration and thirdly the one commanded by ormasov hemperor was with the first army but not as commanderinchief n theorders issued it was stated not that the mperor would take commandbut only that he would be with the army he mperor moreover had withhim not a commanderinchiefs staff but the imperial headquartersstaff n attendance on him was the head of the imperial staffuartermaster eneral rince olkonski as well as generals imperialaidesdecamp diplomatic officials and a large number of foreignersbut not the army staff esides these there were in attendance on themperor without any definite appointments rakcheev the exinister ofar ount ennigsen the senior general in rank the rand

emigre olzogenand many others hough these men had nomilitary appointment in the army their position gave them influenceand often a corps commander or even the commanderinchief did notknow in what capacity he was questioned by ennigsen the rand ukerakcheev or rince olkonski or was given this or that advice and didnot know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanatedfrom the man who gave it or from the mperor and whether it had to beexecuted or not ut this was only the external condition the essentialsignificance of the presence of the mperor and of all these peoplefrom a courtiers point of view and in an mperors vicinity all becamecourtiers was clear to everyone t was this the mperor did notassume the title of commanderinchief but disposed of all the armiesthe men around him were his assistants rakcheev was a faithfulcustodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereigns bodyguardennigsen was a landlord in the ilna province who appeared to be doingthe honors of the district but was in reality a good general useful asan adviser and ready at hand to replace arclay he rand uke wasthere because it suited him to be he exinister tein was therebecause his advice was useful and the mperor lexander held him in highesteem personally rmfeldt virulently hated apoleon and was a generalfull of selfconfidence a quality that always influenced lexanderaulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech headjutants general were there because they always accompanied themperor and lastly and chiefly fuel was there because he had drawn upthe plan of campaign against apoleon and having induced lexander tobelieve in the efficacy of that plan was directing the whole businessof the war ith fuel was olzogen who expressed fuels thoughts in amore comprehensible way than fuel himself who was a harsh bookishtheorist selfconfident to the point of despising everyone else wasable to doesides these ussians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpectedideas every dayespecially the foreigners who did so with a boldnesscharacteristic of people employed in a country not their ownthere weremany secondary personages accompanying the army because their principalswere theremong the opinions and voices in this immense restless brilliant andproud sphere rince ndrew noticed the following sharply definedsubdivisions of tendencies and partieshe first party consisted of fuel and his adherentsmilitary theoristswho believed in a science of war with immutable lawslaws of obliquemovements outflankings and so forth fuel and his adherents demandeda retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with preciselaws defined by a pseudotheory of war and they saw only barbarismignorance or evil intention in every deviation from that theory othis party belonged the foreign nobles olzogen intzingerode andothers chiefly ermanshe second party was directly opposed to the first one extreme asalways happens was met by representatives of the other he members ofthis party were those who had demanded an advance from ilna into olandand freedom from all prearranged plans esides being advocates of boldaction this section also represented nationalism which made them stillmore onesided in the dispute hey were ussians agration rmolovwho was beginning to come to the front and others t that time afamous joke of rmolovs was being circulated that as a great favor hehad petitioned the mperor to make him a erman he men of that partyremembering uvorov said that what one had to do was not to reason orstick pins into maps but to fight beat the enemy keep him out ofussia and not let the army get discouragedo the third partyin which the mperor had most confidencebelongedthe courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other twohe members of this party chiefly civilians and to whom rakcheevbelonged thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish toseem to have some generally say hey said that undoubtedly warparticularly against such a genius as onaparte they called himonaparte now needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientificknowledge and in that respect fuel was a genius but at the same timeit had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often onesided andtherefore one should not trust them absolutely but should also listento what fuels opponents and practical men of experience in warfare hadto say and then choose a middle course hey insisted on the retentionof the camp at rissa according to fuels plan but on changing themovements of the other armies hough by this course neither one aimnor the other could be attained yet it seemed best to the adherents ofthis third partyf a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was thesarevich who could not forget his disillusionment at usterlitz wherehe had ridden out at the head of the uards in his casque and cavalryuniform as to a review expecting to crush the rench gallantly butunexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amidthe general confusion he men of this party had both the quality andthe defect of frankness in their opinions hey feared apoleonrecognized his strength and their own weakness and frankly said sohey said othing but sorrow shame and ruin will come of all thise have abandoned ilna and itebsk and shall abandon rissa he onlyreasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possiblebefore we are turned out of etersburghis view was very general in the upper army circles and found supportalso in etersburg and from the chancellor umyantsev who for otherreasons of state was in favor of peacehe fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of arclay deolly not so much as a man but as minister of war and commanderinchief e he what he may they always began like that he is anhonest practical man and we have nobody better ive him real powerfor war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command andhe will show what he can do as he did in inland f our army is wellorganized and strong and has withdrawn to rissa without suffering anydefeats we owe this entirely to arclay f arclay is now to besuperseded by ennigsen all will be lost for ennigsen showed hisincapacity already in he sixth party the ennigsenites said on the contrary that at anyrate there was no one more active and experienced than ennigsen andtwist about as you may you will have to come to ennigsen eventuallyet the others make mistakes now said they arguing that ourretirement to rissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken seriesof blunders he more mistakes that are made the better t will at anyrate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like thishat is wanted is not some arclay or other but a man like ennigsenwho made his mark in  and to whom apoleon himself did justiceaman whose authority would be willingly recognized and ennigsen is theonly such manhe seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to befound especially around young sovereigns and of whom there wereparticularly many round lexandergenerals and imperial aidesdecamppassionately devoted to the mperor not merely as a monarch but as aman adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly as ostov had done in and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all humancapabilities as well hese men though enchanted with the sovereign forrefusing the command of the army yet blamed him for such excessivemodesty and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereignshould abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would placehimself at the head of the army gather round him a commanderinchiefsstaff and consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men wherenecessary would himself lead the troops whose spirits would thereby beraised to the highest pitchhe eighth and largest group which in its enormous numbers was to theothers as ninetynine to one consisted of men who desired neither peacenor war neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the rissa oranywhere else neither arclay nor the mperor neither fuel norennigsen but only the one most essential thingas much advantage andpleasure for themselves as possible n the troubled waters ofconflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the mperorsheadquarters it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable atother times  man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post wouldtoday agree with fuel tomorrow with his opponent and the day aftermerely to avoid responsibility or to please the mperor would declarethat he had no opinion at all on the matter nother who wished to gainsome advantage would attract the mperors attention by loudlyadvocating the very thing the mperor had hinted at the day before andwould dispute and shout at the council beating his breast andchallenging those who did not agree with him to duels thereby provingthat he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good  thirdin the absence of opponents between two councils would simply solicit aspecial gratuity for his faithful services well knowing that at thatmoment people would be too busy to refuse him  fourth while seeminglyoverwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the mperorseye  fifth to achieve his longcherished aim of dining with themperor would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of somenewly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments moreor less forcible and correctll the men of this party were fishing for rubles decorations andpromotions and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperialfavor and directly they noticed it turning in any direction this wholedrone population of the army began blowing hard that way so that it wasall the harder for the mperor to turn it elsewhere mid theuncertainties of the position with the menace of serious danger givinga peculiarly threatening character to everything amid this vortex ofintrigue egotism conflict of views and feelings and the diversity ofrace among these peoplethis eighth and largest party of thosepreoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion andobscurity to the common task hatever question arose a swarm of thesedrones without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme flewover to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices ofthose who were disputing honestlyrom among all these parties just at the time rince ndrew reached thearmy another a ninth party was being formed and was beginning toraise its voice his was the party of the elders reasonable menexperienced and capable in state affairs who without sharing any ofthose conflicting opinions were able to take a detached view of whatwas going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means ofescape from this muddle indecision intricacy and weaknesshe men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resultedchiefly from the mperors presence in the army with his military courtand from the consequent presence there of an indefinite conditionaland unsteady fluctuation of relations which is in place at court butharmful in an army that a sovereign should reign but not command thearmy and that the only way out of the position would be for the mperorand his court to leave the army that the mere presence of the mperorparalyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure hispersonal safety and that the worst commanderinchief if independentwould be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence andauthority of the monarchust at the time rince ndrew was living unoccupied at rissahishkov the ecretary of tate and one of the chief representatives ofthis party wrote a letter to the mperor which rakcheev and alashevagreed to sign n this letter availing himself of permission given himby the mperor to discuss the general course of affairs he respectfullysuggestedon the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arousea warlike spirit in the people of the capitalthat the mperor shouldleave the armyhat arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them todefend their countrythe very incitement which was the chief cause ofussias triumph in so far as it was produced by the sars personalpresence in oscowwas suggested to the mperor and accepted by himas a pretext for quitting the army his letter had not yet been presented to the mperor when arclay oneday at dinner informed olkonski that the sovereign wished to see himpersonally to question him about urkey and that rince ndrew was topresent himself at ennigsens quarters at six that eveningews was received at the mperors quarters that very day of a freshmovement by apoleon which might endanger the armynews subsequentlyfound to be false nd that morning olonel ichaud had ridden round therissa fortifications with the mperor and had pointed out to him thatthis fortified camp constructed by fuel and till then considered achefdoeuvre of tactical science which would ensure apoleonsdestruction was an absurdity threatening the destruction of theussian armyrince ndrew arrived at ennigsens quartersa country gentlemanshouse of moderate size situated on the very banks of the river eitherennigsen nor the mperor was there but hernyshev the mperors aidedecamp received olkonski and informed him that the mperoraccompanied by eneral ennigsen and arquis aulucci had gone a secondtime that day to inspect the fortifications of the rissa camp of thesuitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felthernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a rench novelin his hand his room had probably been a music room there was stillan organ in it on which some rugs were piled and in one corner stoodthe folding bedstead of ennigsens adjutant his adjutant was alsothere and sat dozing on the rolledup bedding evidently exhausted bywork or by feasting wo doors led from the room one straight on intowhat had been the drawing room and another on the right to the studyhrough the first door came the sound of voices conversing in erman andoccasionally in rench n that drawing room were gathered by themperors wish not a military council the mperor preferredindefiniteness but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know inview of the impending difficulties t was not a council of war but asit were a council to elucidate certain questions for the mperorpersonally o this semicouncil had been invited the wedish eneralrmfeldt djutant eneral olzogen intzingerode whom apoleon hadreferred to as a renegade rench subject ichaud oll ount teinwho was not a military man at all and fuel himself who as rincendrew had heard was the mainspring of the whole affair rince ndrewhad an opportunity of getting a good look at him for fuel arrived soonafter himself and in passing through to the drawing room stopped aminute to speak to hernyshevt first sight fuel in his illmade uniform of a ussian generalwhich fitted him badly like a fancy costume seemed familiar to rincendrew though he saw him now for the first time here was about himsomething of eyrother ack and chmidt and many other ermantheoristgenerals whom rince ndrew had seen in  but he was moretypical than any of them rince ndrew had never yet seen a ermantheorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united tosuch an extentfuel was short and very thin but broadboned of coarse robust buildbroad in the hips and with prominent shoulder blades is face was muchwrinkled and his eyes deep set is hair had evidently been hastilybrushed smooth in front of the temples but stuck up behind in quaintlittle tufts e entered the room looking restlessly and angrilyaround as if afraid of everything in that large apartment wkwardlyholding up his sword he addressed hernyshev and asked in erman wherethe mperor was ne could see that he wished to pass through the roomsas quickly as possible finish with the bows and greetings and sit downto business in front of a map where he would feel at home e noddedhurriedly in reply to hernyshev and smiled ironically on hearing thatthe sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he fuel hadplanned in accord with his theory e muttered something to himselfabruptly and in a bass voice as selfassured ermans doit might havebeen stupid fellow or the whole affair will be ruined orsomething absurd will come of it rince ndrew did not catch whathe said and would have passed on but hernyshev introduced him tofuel remarking that rince ndrew was just back from urkey where thewar had terminated so fortunately fuel barely glancednot so much atrince ndrew as past himand said with a laugh hat must have beena fine tactical war and laughing contemptuously went on into theroom from which the sound of voices was heardfuel always inclined to be irritably sarcastic was particularlydisturbed that day evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspectand criticize his camp in his absence rom this short interview withfuel rince ndrew thanks to his usterlitz experiences was able toform a clear conception of the man fuel was one of those hopelesslyand immutably selfconfident men selfconfident to the point ofmartyrdom as only ermans are because only ermans are selfconfidenton the basis of an abstract notionscience that is the supposedknowledge of absolute truth  renchman is selfassured because heregards himself personally both in mind and body as irresistiblyattractive to men and women n nglishman is selfassured as being acitizen of the bestorganized state in the world and therefore as annglishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does asan nglishman is undoubtedly correct n talian is selfassured becausehe is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people  ussianis selfassured just because he knows nothing and does not want to knowanything since he does not believe that anything can be known heermans selfassurance is worst of all stronger and more repulsivethan any other because he imagines that he knows the truthsciencewhich he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truthfuel was evidently of that sort e had a sciencethe theory ofoblique movements deduced by him from the history of rederick thereats wars and all he came across in the history of more recentwarfare seemed to him absurd and barbarousmonstrous collisions inwhich so many blunders were committed by both sides that these warscould not be called wars they did not accord with the theory andtherefore could not serve as material for sciencen  fuel had been one of those responsible for the plan ofcampaign that ended in ena and uerstadt but he did not see the leastproof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war nthe contrary the deviations made from his theory were in his opinionthe sole cause of the whole disaster and with characteristicallygleeful sarcasm he would remark here  said the whole affair wouldgo to the devil fuel was one of those theoreticians who so love theirtheory that they lose sight of the theorys objectits practicalapplication is love of theory made him hate everything practical andhe would not listen to it e was even pleased by failures for failuresresulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to himthe accuracy of his theorye said a few words to rince ndrew and hernyshev about the presentwar with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrongand who is not displeased that it should be so he unbrushed tufts ofhair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his templesexpressed this most eloquentlye passed into the next room and the deep querulous sounds of hisvoice were at once heard from there rince ndrews eyes were still following fuel out of the room whenount ennigsen entered hurriedly and nodding to olkonski but notpausing went into the study giving instructions to his adjutant as hewent he mperor was following him and ennigsen had hastened on tomake some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereignhernyshev and rince ndrew went out into the porch where the mperorwho looked fatigued was dismounting arquis aulucci was talking tohim with particular warmth and the mperor with his head bent to theleft was listening with a dissatisfied air he mperor moved forwardevidently wishing to end the conversation but the flushed and excitedtalian oblivious of decorum followed him and continued to speaknd as for the man who advised forming this campthe rissa campsaid aulucci as the mperor mounted the steps and noticing rincendrew scanned his unfamiliar face as to that person sirecontinued aulucci desperately apparently unable to restrain himselfthe man who advised the rissa camp see no alternative but thelunatic asylum or the gallowsithout heeding the end of the talians remarks and as though nothearing them the mperor recognizing olkonski addressed himgraciously am very glad to see you o in there where they are meeting and waitfor mehe mperor went into the study e was followed by rince eterikhaylovich olkonski and aron tein and the door closed behind themrince ndrew taking advantage of the mperors permission accompaniedaulucci whom he had known in urkey into the drawing room where thecouncil was assembledrince eter ikhaylovich olkonski occupied the position as it wereof chief of the mperors staff e came out of the study into thedrawing room with some maps which he spread on a table and putquestions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemenpresent hat had happened was that news which afterwards proved to befalse had been received during the night of a movement by the rench tooutflank the rissa camphe first to speak was eneral rmfeldt who to meet the difficulty thatpresented itself unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position awayfrom the etersburg and oscow roads he reason for this wasinexplicable unless he wished to show that he too could have anopinion but he urged that at this point the army should unite andthere await the enemy t was plain that rmfeldt had thought out thatplan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questionsputwhich in fact his plan did not answeras to avail himself of theopportunity to air it t was one of the millions of proposals one asgood as another that could be made as long as it was quite unknown whatcharacter the war would take ome disputed his arguments othersdefended them oung ount oll objected to the wedish generals viewsmore warmly than anyone else and in the course of the dispute drew fromhis side pocket a wellfilled notebook which he asked permission toread to them n these voluminous notes oll suggested another schemetotally different from rmfeldts or fuels plan of campaign n answerto oll aulucci suggested an advance and an attack which he urgedcould alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trapas he called the rissa camp in which we were situateduring all these discussions fuel and his interpreter olzogen hisbridge in court relations were silent fuel only snortedcontemptuously and turned away to show that he would never demeanhimself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing o whenrince olkonski who was in the chair called on him to give hisopinion he merely saidhy ask me eneral rmfeldt has proposed a splendid position with anexposed rear or why not this talian gentlemans attackvery fine ora retreat also good hy ask me said he hy you yourselves knoweverything better than  dout when olkonski said with a frown that it was in the mperors namethat he asked his opinion fuel rose and suddenly growing animatedbegan to speakverything has been spoiled everything muddled everybody thought theyknew better than  did and now you come to me ow mend matters hereis nothing to mend he principles laid down by me must be strictlyadhered to said he drumming on the table with his bony fingers hatis the difficulty onsense childishnesse went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that noeventuality could alter the efficiency of the rissa camp thateverything had been foreseen and that if the enemy were really going tooutflank it the enemy would inevitably be destroyedaulucci who did not know erman began questioning him in rencholzogen came to the assistance of his chief who spoke rench badlyand began translating for him hardly able to keep pace with fuel whowas rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened but allthat could happen had been foreseen in his scheme and that if therewere now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his planhad not been precisely executed e kept laughing sarcastically hedemonstrated and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate like amathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of aproblem that has already been proved olzogen took his place andcontinued to explain his views in rench every now and then turning tofuel and saying s it not so your excellency ut fuel like a manheated in a fight who strikes those on his own side shouted angrily athis own supporter olzogenell of course what more is there to explainaulucci and ichaud both attacked olzogen simultaneously in renchrmfeldt addressed fuel in erman oll explained to olkonski inussian rince ndrew listened and observed in silencef all these men rince ndrew sympathized most with fuel angrydetermined and absurdly selfconfident as he was f all those presentevidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself nursed nohatred against anyone and only desired that the plan formed on atheory arrived at by years of toil should be carried out e wasridiculous and unpleasantly sarcastic but yet he inspired involuntaryrespect by his boundless devotion to an idea esides this the remarksof all except fuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable atthe council of war in  there was now a panic fear of apoleonsgenius which though concealed was noticeable in every rejoinderverything was assumed to be possible for apoleon they expected himfrom every side and invoked his terrible name to shatter each othersproposals fuel alone seemed to consider apoleon a barbarian likeeveryone else who opposed his theory ut besides this feeling ofrespect fuel evoked pity in rince ndrew rom the tone in which thecourtiers addressed him and the way aulucci had allowed himself tospeak of him to the mperor but above all from a certain desperation infuels own expressions it was clear that the others knew and fuelhimself felt that his fall was at hand nd despite his selfconfidenceand grumpy erman sarcasm he was pitiable with his hair smoothlybrushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind hough heconcealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt he wasevidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying histheory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole worldwas slipping away from himhe discussions continued a long time and the longer they lasted themore heated became the disputes culminating in shouts andpersonalities and the less was it possible to arrive at any generalconclusion from all that had been said rince ndrew listening to thispolyglot talk and to these surmises plans refutations and shoutsfelt nothing but amazement at what they were saying  thought that hadlong since and often occurred to him during his military activitiestheidea that there is not and cannot be any science of war and thattherefore there can be no such thing as a military geniusnow appearedto him an obvious truth hat theory and science is possible about amatter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannotbe defined especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot beascertained o one was or is able to foresee in what condition our orthe enemys armies will be in a days time and no one can gauge theforce of this or that detachment ometimeswhen there is not a cowardat the front to shout e are cut off and start running but a braveand jolly lad who shouts urraha detachment of five thousand isworth thirty thousand as at chon rabern while at times fiftythousand run from eight thousand as at usterlitz hat science canthere be in a matter in which as in all practical matters nothing canbe defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions thesignificance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrivesno one knows when rmfeldt says our army is cut in half and auluccisays we have got the rench army between two fires ichaud says thatthe worthlessness of the rissa camp lies in having the river behind itand fuel says that is what constitutes its strength oll proposes oneplan rmfeldt another and they are all good and all bad and theadvantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trialnd why do they all speak of a military genius s a man a genius whocan order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to goto the right and who to the left t is only because military men areinvested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter powerattributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess he bestgenerals  have known were on the contrary stupid or absentmindedmen agration was the best apoleon himself admitted that nd ofonaparte himself  remember his limited selfsatisfied face on thefield of usterlitz ot only does a good army commander not need anyspecial qualities on the contrary he needs the absence of the highestand best human attributeslove poetry tenderness and philosophicinquiring doubt e should be limited firmly convinced that what he isdoing is very important otherwise he will not have sufficientpatience and only then will he be a brave leader od forbid that heshould be humane should love or pity or think of what is just andunjust t is understandable that a theory of their genius wasinvented for them long ago because they have power he success of amilitary action depends not on them but on the man in the ranks whoshouts e are lost or who shouts urrah nd only in the rankscan one serve with assurance of being usefulo thought rince ndrew as he listened to the talking and he rousedhimself only when aulucci called him and everyone was leavingt the review next day the mperor asked rince ndrew where he wouldlike to serve and rince ndrew lost his standing in court circlesforever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereigns person butfor permission to serve in the army efore the beginning of the campaign ostov had received a letter fromhis parents in which they told him briefly of atashas illness and thebreaking off of her engagement to rince ndrew which they explained byatashas having rejected him and again asked icholas to retire fromthe army and return home n receiving this letter icholas did noteven make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from thearmy but wrote to his parents that he was sorry atasha was ill and herengagement broken off and that he would do all he could to meet theirwishes o onya he wrote separatelydored friend of my soul he wrote othing but honor could keep mefrom returning to the country ut now at the commencement of thecampaign  should feel dishonored not only in my comrades eyes but inmy own if  preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to theatherland ut this shall be our last separation elieve me directlythe war is over if  am still alive and still loved by you  willthrow up everything and fly to you to press you forever to my ardentbreastt was in fact only the commencement of the campaign that preventedostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying onya heautumn in tradnoe with the hunting and the winter with the hristmasholidays and onyas love had opened out to him a vista of tranquilrural joys and peace such as he had never known before and which nowallured him  splendid wife children a good pack of hounds a dozenleashes of smart borzois agriculture neighbors service byelection thought he ut now the campaign was beginning and he hadto remain with his regiment nd since it had to be so icholas ostovas was natural to him felt contented with the life he led in theregiment and was able to find pleasure in that lifen his return from his furlough icholas having been joyfully welcomedby his comrades was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from thekraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendationfrom his commanders uring his absence he had been promoted captainand when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase innumbers he was again allotted his old squadronhe campaign began the regiment was moved into oland on double paynew officers arrived new men and horses and above all everybody wasinfected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencementof a war and ostov conscious of his advantageous position in theregiment devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests ofmilitary service though he knew that sooner or later he would have torelinquish themhe troops retired from ilna for various complicated reasons of statepolitical and strategic ach step of the retreat was accompanied by acomplicated interplay of interests arguments and passions atheadquarters or the avlograd hussars however the whole of thisretreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplieswas a very simple and agreeable businesst was only at headquarters that there was depression uneasiness andintriguing in the body of the army they did not ask themselves wherethey were going or why f they regretted having to retreat it was onlybecause they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to or somepretty young olish lady f the thought that things looked bad chancedto enter anyones head he tried to be as cheerful as befits a goodsoldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs but only ofthe task nearest to hand irst they camped gaily before ilna makingacquaintance with the olish landowners preparing for reviews and beingreviewed by the mperor and other high commanders hen came an order toretreat to ventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not carryaway with them ventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as thedrunken camp a name the whole army gave to their encampment there andbecause many complaints were made against the troops who takingadvantage of the order to collect provisions took also horsescarriages and carpets from the olish proprietors ostov rememberedventsyani because on the first day of their arrival at that small townhe changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunkenmen of his squadron who unknown to him had appropriated five barrelsof old beer rom ventsyani they retired farther and farther to rissaand thence again beyond rissa drawing near to the frontier of ussiapropern the thirteenth of uly the avlograds took part in a serious actionfor the first timen the twelfth of uly on the eve of that action there was a heavystorm of rain and hail n general the summer of  was remarkablefor its stormshe two avlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye whichwas already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle andhorses he rain was descending in torrents and ostov with a youngofficer named lyin his protege was sitting in a hastily constructedshelter n officer of their regiment with long mustaches extendingonto his cheeks who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by therain entered ostovs shelter have come from the staff ount ave you heard of aevskisexploitnd the officer gave them details of the altanov battle which he hadheard at the staffostov smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the watertrickled down his neck listened inattentively with an occasionalglance at lyin who was pressing close to him his officer a lad ofsixteen who had recently joined the regiment was now in the samerelation to icholas that icholas had been to enisov seven yearsbefore lyin tried to imitate ostov in everything and adored him as agirl might have donedrzhinski the officer with the long mustache spoke grandiloquently ofthe altanov dam being a ussian hermopylae and of how a deed worthyof antiquity had been performed by eneral aevski e recounted howaevski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and hadcharged with them beside him ostov heard the story and not only saidnothing to encourage drzhinskis enthusiasm but on the contrarylooked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing though with nointention of contradicting it ince the campaigns of usterlitz and of ostov knew by experience that men always lie when describingmilitary exploits as he himself had done when recounting them besidesthat he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war atall as we can imagine or relate it nd so he did not like drzhinskistale nor did he like drzhinski himself who with his mustachesextending over his cheeks bent low over the face of his hearer as washis habit and crowded ostov in the narrow shanty ostov looked at himin silence n the first place there must have been such a confusionand crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if aevski did leadhis sons there it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozenmen nearest to him thought he the rest could not have seen how orwith whom aevski came onto the dam nd even those who did see it wouldnot have been much stimulated by it for what had they to do withaevskis tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in dangernd besides the fate of the atherland did not depend on whether theytook the altanov dam or not as we are told was the case athermopylae o why should he have made such a sacrifice nd why exposehis own children in the battle  would not have taken my brother etyathere or even lyin whos a stranger to me but a nice lad but wouldhave tried to put them somewhere under cover icholas continued tothink as he listened to drzhinski ut he did not express histhoughts for in such matters too he had gained experience e knewthat this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had topretend not to doubt it nd he acted accordingly cant stand this any more said lyin noticing that ostov did notrelish drzhinskis conversation y stockings and shirt and thewater is running on my seat ll go and look for shelter he rainseems less heavylyin went out and drzhinski rode awayive minutes later

tiny recess behind a partition to change but found itcompletely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the lightof a solitary candle on an empty box and these officers would on noaccount

and happilye is sleeping well as it is after a sleepless nighth no ary endrikhovna replied the officer one must look afterthe doctor erhaps hell take pity on me someday when it comes tocutting off a leg or an arm for mehere were only three tumblers the water was so muddy that one couldnot make out whether the tea was strong or weak and the samovar heldonly six tumblers of water but this made it all the pleasanter to taketurns in order of seniority to receive ones tumbler from aryendrikhovnas plump little hands with their short and not overcleannails ll the officers appeared to be and really

the middleof which his wifes nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathingaudiblehe really is a dear little thing said ostov to lyin who wasfollowing him charming woman said lyin with all the gravity

the hussars withclanking sabers and subdued talk their horses hoofs splashing in themud defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birchtrees on each side following the infantry and

but a ossack horse  judge of horses and a sportsman hehad lately procured himself a large fine mettlesome onets horseduncolored with light mane and tail and when he rode it no one couldoutgallop him o ride this horse was a pleasure to him and he thoughtof the horse of the morning of the doctors wife but not once of theimpending dangerormerly when going into action ostov had felt afraid now he had notthe least feeling of fear e was fearless not because he had grownused to being under fire one cannot grow used to danger but becausehe had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger e had grownaccustomed when going into action to think about anything but what wouldseem most likely to interest himthe impending danger uring the firstperiod of his service hard as he tried and much as he reproachedhimself with cowardice he had not been able to do this but with timeit had come of itself ow he rode beside lyin under the birch treesoccasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand sometimestouching his horses side with his foot or without turning roundhanding a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him with ascalm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride eglanced with pity at the excited face of lyin who talked much and ingreat agitation e knew from experience the tormenting expectation ofterror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time couldhelp hims soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the cloudsthe wind fell as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morningafter the storm drops still

from behind the top of the cloud tearing itsedge verything grew bright and glittered nd with that light and asif in reply to it came the sound of guns ahead of themefore ostov had had time to consider and determine the distance ofthat firing ount stermannolstoys adjutant came galloping fromitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the roadhe squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the

as the uhlans descended the hill the hussars were ordered upthe hill to support the battery s they took the places vacated by theuhlans bullets came from the front whining and whistling but fellspent without taking effecthe sounds which he had not heard for so long had an even morepleasurable and exhilarating effect on ostov than the previous soundsof firing rawing himself up he viewed the field of battle opening outbefore him from the hill and with his whole soul followed the movementof the uhlans hey swooped down close to the rench dragoons somethingconfused happened there amid the smoke and five minutes later ouruhlans were galloping back not to the place they had occupied but moreto the left and among the orangecolored uhlans on chestnut horses andbehind them in a large group blue rench dragoons on gray horses couldbe seen ostov with his keen sportsmans eye was one of the first to catchsight of these blue rench dragoons pursuing our uhlans earer andnearer in disorderly crowds came the uhlans and the rench dragoonspursuing them e could already see how these men who looked so smallat the foot of the hill jostled and overtook one another waving theirarms and their sabers in the airostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt e feltinstinctively that if the hussars struck at the rench dragoons now thelatter could not withstand them but if a charge was to be made it mustbe done now at that very moment or it would be too late e lookedaround  captain standing beside him was gazing like himself witheyes fixed on the cavalry below themndrew evastyanych said ostov ou know we could crush them fine thing too replied the captain and reallyostov without waiting to hear him out touched his horse galloped tothe front of his squadron and before he had time to finish giving theword of command the whole squadron sharing his feeling was followinghim ostov himself did not know how or why he did it e acted as hedid when hunting without reflecting or considering e saw the dragoonsnear and that they were galloping in disorder he knew they could notwithstand an attackknew there was only that moment and that if he letit slip it would not return he bullets were whining and whistling sostimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he couldnot restrain himself e touched his horse gave the word of commandand immediately hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of hisdeployed squadron rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoonsardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their paceinstinctively changed to a gallop which grew faster and faster as theydrew nearer to our uhlans and the rench dragoons who galloped afterthem he dragoons were now close at hand n seeing the hussars theforemost began to turn while those behind began to halt ith the samefeeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf ostovgave rein to his onets horse and galloped to intersect the path of thedragoons disordered lines ne hlan stopped another who was on footflung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over and a riderlesshorse fell in among the hussars early all the rench dragoons weregalloping back ostov picking out one on a gray horse dashed afterhim n the way he came upon a bush his gallant horse cleared it andalmost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he wouldimmediately overtake the enemy he had selected hat renchman by hisuniform an officer was going at a gallop crouching on his gray horseand urging it on with his saber n another moment ostovs horse dashedits breast against the hindquarters of the officers horse almostknocking it over and at the same instant ostov without knowing whyraised his saber and struck the renchman with ithe instant he had done this all ostovs animation vanished heofficer fell not so much from the blowwhich had but slightly cut hisarm above the elbowas from the shock to his horse and from frightostov reined in his horse and his eyes sought his foe to see whom hehad vanquished he rench dragoon officer was hopping with one foot onthe ground the other being caught in the stirrup is eyes screwed upwith fear as if he every moment expected another blow gazed up atostov with shrinking terror is pale and mudstained facefair andyoung with a dimple in the chin and lightblue eyeswas not an enemysface at all suited to a battlefield but a most ordinary homelike faceefore ostov had decided what to do with him the officer cried surrender e hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of thestirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from ostovs faceome hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into thesaddle n all sides the hussars were busy with the dragoons one waswounded but though his face was bleeding he would not give up hishorse another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round hima third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse n front therench infantry were firing as they ran he hussars galloped hastilyback with their prisoners ostov galloped back with the rest aware ofan unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart omething vague andconfused which he could not at all account for had come over him withthe capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt himount stermannolstoy met the returning hussars sent for ostovthanked him and said he would report his gallant deed to the mperorand would recommend him for a t eorges ross hen sent for by ountstermann ostov remembering that he had charged without orders feltsure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach ofdiscipline stermanns flattering words and promise of a reward shouldtherefore have struck him all the more pleasantly but he still feltthat same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea ut what onearth is worrying me he asked himself as he rode back from thegeneral lyin o hes safe ave  disgraced myself in any way othats not it omething else resembling remorse tormented him esoh yes that rench officer with the dimple nd  remember how my armpaused when  raised itostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to havea look at his renchman with the dimple on his chin e was sitting inhis foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously abouthim he sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound eglanced at ostov with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greetingostov still had the same indefinite feeling as of shamell that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that ostovwithout being dull or angry was silent thoughtful and preoccupied edrank reluctantly tried to remain alone and kept turning somethingover in his mindostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his which tohis amazement had gained him the t eorges ross and even given him areputation for bravery and there was something he could not at allunderstand o others are even more afraid than  am he thought othats all there is in what is called heroism nd did  do it for mycountrys sake nd how was he to blame with his dimple and blue eyesnd how frightened he was e thought that  should kill him hy should kill him y hand trembled nd they have given me a t eorgesross  cant make it out at allut while icholas was considering these questions and still could reachno clear solution of what puzzled him so the wheel of fortune in theservice as often happens turned in his favor fter the affair atstrovna he was brought into notice received command of an hussarbattalion and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen n receiving news of atashas illness the countess though not quitewell yet and still weak went to oscow with etya and the rest of thehousehold and the whole family moved from arya mitrievnas house totheir own and settled down in townatashas illness was so serious that fortunately for her and for herparents the consideration of all that had caused the illness herconduct and the breaking off of her engagement receded into thebackground he was so ill that it was impossible for them to considerin how far she was to blame for what had happened he could not eat orsleep grew visibly thinner coughed and as the doctors made themfeel was in danger hey could not think of anything but how to helpher octors came to see her singly and in consultation talked much inrench erman and atin blamed one another and prescribed a greatvariety of medicines for all the diseases known to them but the simpleidea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the diseaseatasha was suffering from as no disease suffered by a live man can beknown for every living person has his own peculiarities and always hashis own peculiar personal novel complicated disease unknown tomedicinenot a disease of the lungs liver skin heart nerves and soon mentioned in medical books but a disease consisting of one of theinnumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs his simplethought could not occur to the doctors as it cannot occur to a wizardthat he is unable to work his charms because the business of theirlives was to cure and they received money for it and had spent the bestyears of their lives on that business ut above all that thought waskept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were reallyuseful as in fact they were to the whole ostov family heirusefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances forthe most part harmful the harm was scarcely perceptible as they weregiven in small doses but they were useful necessary andindispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and ofthose who loved herand that is why there are and always will bepseudohealers wise women homeopaths and allopaths hey satisfiedthat eternal human need for hope of relief for sympathy and thatsomething should be done which is felt by those who are suffering heysatisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child when itwants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt  child knocks itselfand runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the achingspot rubbed or kissed and it feels better when this is done he childcannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have noremedy for its pain and the hope of relief and the expression of itsmothers sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it he doctors wereof use to atasha because they kissed and rubbed her bump assuring herthat it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemists inthe rbat and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a rubleand seventy kopeks and if she took those powders in boiled water atintervals of precisely two hours neither more nor lesshat would onya and the count and countess have done how would theyhave looked if nothing had been done if there had not been those pillsto give by the clock the warm drinks the chicken cutlets and all theother details of life ordered by the doctors the carrying out of whichsupplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle ow wouldthe count have borne his dearly loved daughters illness had he notknown that it was costing him a thousand rubles and that he would notgrudge thousands more to benefit her or had he not known that if herillness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would takeher abroad for consultations there and had he not been able to explainthe details of how etivier and eller had not understood the symptomsbut rise had and udrov had diagnosed them even better hat would thecountess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalidfor not strictly obeying the doctors ordersoull never get well like that she would say forgetting her griefin her vexation if you wont obey the doctor and take your medicine atthe right time ou mustnt trifle with it you know or it may turn topneumonia she would go on deriving much comfort from the utterance ofthat foreign word incomprehensible to others as well as to herselfhat would onya have done without the glad consciousness that she hadnot undressed during the first three nights in order to be ready tocarry out all the doctors injunctions with precision and that shestill kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when theslightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administeredven to atasha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrificeswere being made for her sake and to know that she had to take medicineat certain hours though she declared that no medicine would cure herand that it was all nonsense nd it was even pleasant to be able toshow by disregarding the orders that she did not believe in medicaltreatment and did not value her lifehe doctor came every day felt her pulse looked at her tongue andregardless of her griefstricken face joked with her ut when he hadgone into another room to which the countess hurriedly followed him heassumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that thoughthere was danger he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine andone must wait and see that the malady was chiefly mental but ndthe countess trying to conceal the action from herself and from himslipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patientwith a more tranquil mindhe symptoms of atashas illness were that she ate little sleptlittle coughed and was always lowspirited he doctors said that shecould not get on without medical treatment so they kept her in thestifling atmosphere of the town and the ostovs did not move to thecountry that summer of n spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders outof the little bottles and boxes of which adame choss who was fond ofsuch things made a large collection and in spite of being deprived ofthe country life to which she was accustomed youth prevailed atashasgrief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life it ceasedto press so painfully on her heart it gradually faded into the pastand she began to recover physically atasha was calmer but no happier he not merely avoided all externalforms of pleasureballs promenades concerts and theatersbut shenever laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter he could notsing s soon as she began to laugh or tried to sing by herself tearschoked her tears of remorse tears at the recollection of those puretimes which could never return tears of vexation that she should souselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happyaughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy inface of her sorrow ithout any need of selfrestraint no wish tocoquet ever entered her head he said and felt at that time that no manwas more to her than astasya vanovna the buffoon omething stoodsentinel within her and forbade her every joy esides she had lost allthe old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full ofhope he previous autumn the hunting ncle and the hristmasholidays spent with icholas at tradnoe were what she recalled oftenestand most painfully hat would she not have given to bring back even asingle day of that time ut it was gone forever er presentiment atthe time had not deceived herthat that state of freedom and readinessfor any enjoyment would not return again et it was necessary to liveont comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerlyimagined but worse much worse than anybody else in the world utthis was not enough he knew that and asked herself hat next utthere was nothing to come here was no joy in life yet life waspassing atasha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance toanyone but wanted nothing for herself he kept away from everyone inthe house and felt at ease only with her brother etya he liked to bewith him better than with the others and when alone with him shesometimes laughed he hardly ever left the house and of those who cameto see them was glad to see only one person ierre t would have beenimpossible to treat her with more delicacy greater care and at thesame time more seriously than did ount ezukhov atasha unconsciouslyfelt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society ut shewas not even grateful to him for it nothing good on ierres partseemed to her to be an effort it seemed so natural for him to be kindto everyone that there was no merit in his kindness ometimes atashanoticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presenceespecially when he wanted to do something to please her or feared thatsomething they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her henoticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shynesswhich she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to herfter those involuntary wordsthat if he were free he would have askedon his knees for her hand and her loveuttered at a moment when she wasso strongly agitated ierre never spoke to atasha of his feelings andit seemed plain to her that those words which had then so comfortedher were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comforta crying child t was not because ierre was a married man but becauseatasha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence ofwhich she had experienced with uragin that it never entered her headthat the relations between him and herself could lead to love on herpart still less on his or even to the kind of tender selfconsciousromantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had knownseveral instancesefore the end of the fast of t eter grafena vanovna elova acountry neighbor of the ostovs came to oscow to pay her devotions atthe shrines of the oscow saints he suggested that atasha should fastand prepare for oly ommunion and atasha gladly welcomed the ideaespite the doctors orders that she should not go out early in themorning atasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacramentnot as they generally prepared for it in the ostov family by attendingthree services in their own house but as grafena vanovna did bygoing to church every day for a week and not once missing espersatins or asshe countess was pleased with atashas zeal after the poor results ofthe medical treatment in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayermight help her daughter more than medicines and though not without fearand concealing it from the doctor she agreed to atashas wish andentrusted her to elova grafena vanovna used to come to wake atashaat three in the morning but generally found her already awake he wasafraid of being late for atins astily washing and meekly putting onher shabbiest dress and an old mantilla atasha shivering in the freshair went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawny grafena vanovnas advice atasha prepared herself not in their ownparish but at a church where according to the devout grafenavanovna the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life here werenever many people in the church atasha always stood beside elova inthe customary place before an icon of the lessed irgin let into thescreen before the choir on the left side and a feeling new to her ofhumility before something great and incomprehensible seized her when atthat unusual morning hour gazing at the dark face of the irginilluminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning lightfalling from the window she listened to the words of the service whichshe tried to follow with understanding hen she understood them herpersonal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of itsown hen she did not understand it was sweeter still to think that thewish to understand everything is pride that it is impossible tounderstand all that it is only necessary to believe and to commitoneself to od whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments hecrossed herself bowed low and when she did not understand in horrorat her own vileness simply asked od to forgive her everythingeverything to have mercy upon her he prayers to which she surrenderedherself most of all were those of repentance n her way home at anearly hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or mensweeping the street and everybody within the houses was still asleepatasha experienced a feeling new to her a sense of the possibility ofcorrecting her faults the possibility of a new clean life and ofhappinessuring the whole week she spent in this way that feeling grew everyday nd the happiness of taking communion or communing as grafenavanovna joyously playing with the word called it seemed to atashaso great that she felt she should never live till that blessed undayut the happy day came and on that memorable unday when dressed inwhite muslin she returned home after communion for the first time formany months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the lifethat lay before herhe doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue thepowders he had prescribed a fortnight previouslyhe must certainly go on taking them morning and evening said heevidently sincerely satisfied with his success nly please beparticular about ite quite easy he continued playfully as he adroitly took the goldcoin in his palm he will soon be singing and frolicking about helast medicine has done her a very great deal of good he has freshenedup very muchhe countess with a cheerful expression on her face looked down at hernails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room t the beginning of uly

overmalek of ideon over idian and of avid over oliath and about thedestruction of hy erusalem and she prayed to od with thetenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing but withoutfully understanding what she was asking of od in that prayer heshared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousnessfor the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope and its animationby love ut she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled underfoot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more ofthem that she might pray for them ut neither could she doubt therighteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees hefelt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of thepunishment that overtakes men for their sins and especially of her ownsins and she prayed to od to forgive them all and her too and togive them all and her too peace and happiness nd it seemed to herthat od heard her prayer rom the day when ierre after leaving the ostovs with atashasgrateful look fresh in his mind had gazed at the comet that seemed tobe fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his ownhorizonfrom that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of allearthly things that had incessantly tormented him no longer presenteditself hat terrible question hy herefore which had come to himamid every occupation was now replaced not by another question or by areply to the former question but by her image hen he listened to orhimself took part in trivial conversations when he read or heard ofhuman baseness or folly he was not horrified as formerly and did notask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is sotransient and incomprehensiblebut he remembered her as he had lastseen her and all his doubts vanishednot because she had answered thequestions that had haunted him but because his conception of hertransferred him instantly to another a brighter realm of spiritualactivity in which no one could be justified or guiltya realm of beautyand love which it was worth living for hatever worldly basenesspresented itself to him he said to himselfell supposing   swindled the country and the sar and thecountry and the sar confer honors upon him what does that matter hesmiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again and  love her andno one will ever know it nd his soul felt calm and peacefulierre still went into society drank as much and led the same idle anddissipated life because besides the hours he spent at the ostovsthere were other hours he had to spend somehow and the habits andacquaintances he had made in oscow formed a current that bore him alongirresistibly ut latterly when more and more disquieting reports camefrom the seat of war and atashas health began to improve and she nolonger aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity an everincreasing restlessness which he could not explain took possession ofhim e felt that the condition he was in could not continue long thata catastrophe was coming which would change his whole life and heimpatiently sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophene of his brother asons had revealed to ierre the following prophecyconcerning apoleon drawn from the evelation of t ohnn chapter  verse  of the pocalypse it is saidere is wisdom et him that hath understanding count the number of thebeast for it is the number of a man and his number is ix hundredthreescore and sixnd in the fifth verse of the same chapternd there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things andblasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and twomonthshe rench alphabet written out with the same numerical values as theebrew in which the first nine letters denote units and the otherstens will have the following significancea   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k                          l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s                    t    u    v    w    x    y            z riting the words mpereur apoleon in numbers it appears that thesum of them is  and that apoleon was therefore the beast foretoldin the pocalypse oreover by applying the same system to the wordsquarantedeux  which was the term allowed to the beast that spokegreat things and blasphemies the same number  was obtained fromwhich it followed that the limit fixed for apoleons power had come inthe year  when the rench emperor was fortytwo his prophecypleased ierre very much and he often asked himself what would put anend to the power of the beast that is of apoleon and tried by thesame system of using letters as numbers and adding them up to find ananswer to the question that engrossed him e wrote the words mpereurlexandre a nation russe and added up their numbers but the sums wereeither more or less than  nce when making such calculations hewrote down his own name in rench omte ierre esouhoff but the sumof the numbers did not come right hen he changed the spellingsubstituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le stillwithout obtaining the desired result hen it occurred to him if theanswer to the question were contained in his name his nationality wouldalso be given in the answer o he wrote e russe esuhof and adding upthe numbers got  his was only five too much and five wasrepresented by e the very letter elided from the article le before theword mpereur y omitting the e though incorrectly ierre got theanswer he sought russe esuhof made  his discovery excited himow or by what means he was connected with the great event foretold inthe pocalypse he did not know but he did not doubt that connection fora moment is love for atasha ntichrist apoleon the invasion thecomet  mpereur apoleon and russe esuhofall this had tomature and culminate to lift him out of that spellbound petty sphereof oscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to agreat achievement and great happiness ortytwon the eve of the unday when the special prayer was read ierre hadpromised the ostovs to bring them from ount ostopchin whom he knewwell both the appeal to the people and the news from the army n themorning when he went to call at ostopchins he met there a courierfresh from the army an acquaintance of his own who often danced atoscow ballso please for heavens sake relieve me of something said thecourier  have a sackful of letters to parentsmong these letters was one from icholas ostov to his father ierretook that letter and ostopchin also gave him the mperors appeal tooscow which had just been printed the last army orders and his ownmost recent bulletin lancing through the army orders ierre found inone of them in the lists of killed wounded and rewarded the name oficholas ostov awarded a t eorges ross of the ourth lass forcourage shown in the strovna affair and in the same order the name ofrince ndrew olkonski appointed to the command of a regiment ofhasseurs hough he did not want to remind the ostovs of olkonskiierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of theirsons having received a decoration so he sent that printed army orderand icholas letter to the ostovs keeping the appeal the bulletinand the other orders to take with him when he went to dinneris conversation with ount ostopchin and the latters tone of anxioushurry the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badlythings were going in the army the rumors of the discovery of spies inoscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that apoleon promised tobe in both the ussian capitals by the autumn and the talk of themperors being expected to arrive next dayall aroused with freshforce that feeling of agitation and expectation in ierre which he hadbeen conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet and especiallysince the beginning of the ware had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done sohad he not been hindered first by his membership of the ociety ofreemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetualpeace and the abolition of war and secondly by the fact that when hesaw the great mass of uscovites who had donned uniform and were talkingpatriotism he somehow felt ashamed to take the step ut the chiefreason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in thevague idea that he was russe esuhof who had the number of the beast that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the powerof the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had beenpredestined from eternity and that therefore he ought not to undertakeanything but wait for what was bound to come to pass  few intimate friends were dining with the ostovs that day as usualon undaysierre came early so as to find them alonee had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had henot been so tall so broad of limb and so strong that he carried hisbulk with evident easee went up the stairs puffing and muttering something is coachman didnot even ask whether he was to wait e knew that when his master was atthe ostovs he stayed till midnight he ostovs footman rushedeagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat andstick ierre from club habit always left both hat and

daywhen trying to comfort her he had said that if he were not himself butthe best man in the world and free he would ask on his knees for herhand and the same feeling of pity tenderness and love took possessionof him and the same words rose to his lips ut she did not give himtime to say themes you you she said uttering the word you rapturouslythats a different thing  know no one kinder more

suddenly stoppedhey looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces e triedto smile but could not his smile expressed suffering and he silentlykissed her hand and went outierre made up his mind not to go to the ostovs any more fter the definite refusal he had received etya went to his room andthere locked himself in and wept bitterly hen he came in to teasilent morose and with tearstained face everybody pretended not tonotice anythingext day the mperor arrived in oscow and several of the ostovsdomestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him hatmorning etya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collarto look like a grownup man e frowned before his looking glassgesticulated shrugged his shoulders and finally without saying a wordto anyone took his cap and left the house by the back door trying toavoid notice etya decided to go straight to where the mperor was andto explain frankly to some gentlemaninwaiting he imagined the mperorto be always surrounded by gentlemeninwaiting that he ount ostovin spite of his youth wished to serve his country that youth could beno hindrance to loyalty and that he was ready to hile dressingetya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentlemaninwaitingt was on the very fact of being so young that etya counted for successin reaching the mperorhe even thought how surprised everyone would beat his youthfulnessand yet in the arrangement of his collar and hairand by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grownup manut the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by theeverincreasing crowds moving toward the remlin the less he rememberedto walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man s he approachedthe remlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuckout his elbows in a menacing way ut within the rinity ateway he wasso pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of thepatriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all hisdetermination he had to give in and stop while carriages passed inrumbling beneath the archway eside etya stood a peasant woman afootman two tradesmen and a discharged soldier fter standing sometime in the gateway etya tried to move forward in front of the otherswithout waiting for all the carriages to pass and he began resolutelyworking his way with his elbows but the woman just in front of him whowas the first against whom he directed his efforts angrily shouted athimhat are you shoving for young lordling ont you see were allstanding still hen why pushnybody can shove said the footman and also began working his elbowsto such effect that he pushed etya into a very filthy corner of thegatewayetya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the dampcollar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a manse felt that he no longer looked presentable and feared that if he werenow to approach the gentlemeninwaiting in that plight he would not beadmitted to the mperor ut it was impossible to smarten oneself up ormove to another place because of the crowd ne of the generals whodrove past was an acquaintance of the ostovs and etya thought ofasking his help but came to the conclusion that that would not be amanly thing to do hen the carriages had all passed in the crowdcarrying etya with it streamed forward into the remlin quare whichwas already full of people here were people not only in the squarebut everywhereon the slopes and on the roofs s soon as etya foundhimself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyousvoices of the crowd that filled the whole remlinor a while the crowd was less dense but suddenly all heads were baredand everyone rushed forward in one direction etya was being pressed sothat he could scarcely breathe and everybody shouted urrah hurrahhurrah etya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched but could seenothing except the people about himll the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm tradesmans wife standing beside etya sobbed and the tears ran downher cheeksather ngel ear one she kept repeating wiping away her tearswith her fingersurrah was heard on all sidesor a moment the crowd stood still but then it made another rushforwarduite beside himself etya clinching his teeth and rolling his eyesferociously pushed forward elbowing his way and shouting hurrah asif he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else buton both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushedforward and everybody shouted hurraho this is what the mperor is thought etya o  cant petitionhim myselfthat would be too bold ut in spite of this he continuedto struggle desperately forward and from between the backs of those infront he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red clothspread out on it but just then the crowd swayed backthe police infront were pushing back those who had pressed too close to theprocession the mperor was passing from the palace to the athedral ofthe ssumptionand etya unexpectedly received such a blow on his sideand ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dimbefore his eyes and he lost consciousness hen he came to himself aman of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of hishead and wearing a shabby blue cassockprobably a church clerk andchanterwas holding him under the arm with one hand while warding offthe pressure of the crowd with the otherouve crushed the young gentleman said the clerk hat are you upto ently heyve crushed him crushed himhe

crushed himne might easily get killed that way hat do they mean by it illingpeople oor dear hes as white as a sheetvarious voices were heardsayingetya soon came to himself the color returned to his face the pain hadpassed and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtaineda place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the mperor who wouldbe returning that way etya no longer thought of presenting hispetition f he could only see the mperor he would be happyhile the service was proceeding in the athedral of the ssumptionitwas a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the mperorsarrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the urksthe crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared selling kvasgingerbread and poppyseed sweets of which etya was particularlyfond and ordinary conversation could again be heard  tradesmanswife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl hadcost another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear he clerkwho had rescued etya was talking to a functionary about the priests whowere officiating that day with the bishop he clerk several times usedthe word plenary of the service a word etya did not understandwo young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were crackingnuts ll these conversations especially the joking with the girlswere such as might have had a particular charm for etya at his age butthey did not interest him now e sat on his elevationthe pedestal ofthe cannonstill agitated as before by the thought of the mperor andby his love for him he feeling of pain and fear he had experiencedwhen he was being crushed together with that of rapture still furtherintensified his sense of the importance of the occasionuddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankmentto celebrate the signing of peace with the urks and the crowd rushedimpetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing etya too wouldhave run there but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman underhis protection stopped him he firing was still proceeding whenofficers generals and gentlemeninwaiting came running out of thecathedral and after them others in a more leisurely manner caps wereagain raised and those who had run to look at the cannon ran backagain t last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from thecathedral doors urrah hurrah shouted the crowd againhich is he hich asked etya in a tearful voice of those aroundhim but no one answered him everybody was too excited and etyafixing on one of those four men whom he could not clearly see for thetears of joy that filled his eyes concentrated all his enthusiasm onhimthough it happened not to be the mperorfrantically shoutedurrah and resolved that tomorrow come what might he would join thearmyhe crowd ran after the mperor followed him to the palace and beganto disperse t was already late and etya had not eaten anything andwas drenched with perspiration yet he did not go home but stood withthat diminishing but still considerable crowd before the palace whilethe mperor dinedlooking in at the palace windows expecting he knewnot what and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entranceto dine

from the sars hand and he felt that hemust not give way e sprang forward and upset an old woman who wascatching at a biscuit the old woman did not consider herself defeatedthough she was lying on the groundshe grabbed at some biscuits but herhand did not reach them etya pushed her hand away with his kneeseized a biscuit and as if fearing to be too late again shoutedurrah with a voice already hoarsehe mperor went in and after that the greater part of the crowd beganto dispersehere  said if only we waitedand so it was was being joyfullysaid by various peopleappy as etya was he felt sad at having to go home knowing that allthe enjoyment of that day was over e did not go straight home from theremlin but called on his friend bolenski who was fifteen and wasalso entering the regiment n returning home etya announced resolutelyand firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would runaway nd next day ount lya ostovthough he had not yet quiteyieldedwent to inquire how he could arrange for etya to serve wherethere would be least danger wo days later on the fifteenth of uly an immense number of carriageswere standing outside the loboda alacehe great halls were full n the first were the nobility and gentry intheir uniforms in the second bearded merchants in fullskirted coats ofblue cloth and wearing medals n the noblemens hall there was anincessant movement and

wanted to speak himself e pushed forward feeling stirred butnot yet sure what stirred him or what he would say carcely had heopened his mouth when one of the senators a man without a tooth in hishead with a shrewd though angry expression standing near the firstspeaker interrupted him vidently accustomed to managing debates andto maintaining an argument he began in low but distinct tones imagine sir said he mumbling with his toothless mouth that wehave been summoned here not to discuss whether its best for the empireat the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militiae have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereignthe mperor has honored us ut to judge what is bestconscription orthe militiawe can leave to the supreme authorityierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement e hardened his heartagainst the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitudeinto the deliberations of the nobility ierre stepped forward andinterrupted him e himself did not yet know what he would say but hebegan to speak eagerly occasionally lapsing into rench or expressinghimself in bookish ussianxcuse me your excellency he began e was well acquainted with thesenator but thought it necessary on this occasion to address himformally hough  dont agree with the gentleman he hesitatedhe wished to say on tres honorable preopinanty very honorableopponent with the gentleman whom  have not the honor of knowing suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to expresstheir sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which wecan

a canon  we are ready to make of ourselvesand not to obtainfrom us any cococounsel ood for cannonany persons withdrew from the circle noticing the senators sarcasticsmile and the freedom of ierres remarks nly ount ostov was pleasedwith them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer thesenator and in general with whatever speech he had last heard think that before discussing these questions ierre continued weshould ask the mperormost respectfully ask is ajestyto let usknow the number of our troops and the position in which our army and ourforces now are and thenut scarcely had ierre uttered these words before he was attacked fromthree sides he most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance aboston player who had always been well disposed toward him tepantepanovich draksin draksin was in uniform and whether as a resultof the uniform or from some other cause ierre saw before him quite adifferent man ith a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged facedraksin shouted at ierren the first place  tell you we have no right to question the mperorabout that and secondly if the ussian nobility had that right themperor could not answer such a question he troops are moved accordingto the enemys movements and the number of men increases anddecreasesnother voice that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty yearsof age whom ierre had formerly met at the gypsies and knew as a badcardplayer and who also transformed by his uniform came up to ierreinterrupted draksines and this is not a time for discussing he continued but foracting there is war in ussia he enemy is advancing to destroyussia to desecrate the tombs of our fathers to carry off our wivesand children he nobleman smote his breast e will all arise everyone of us will go for our father the sar he shouted rolling hisbloodshot eyes everal approving voices were heard in the crowd eare ussians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith thethrone and the atherland e must cease raving if we are sons of ouratherland e will show urope how ussia rises to the defense ofussiaierre wished to reply but could not get in a word e felt that hiswords apart from what meaning they conveyed were less audible than thesound of his opponents voiceount ostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval severalpersons briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of aphrase saidhats right quite right ust soierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money hisserfs or himself only one ought to know the state of affairs in orderto be able to improve it but he was unable to speak any voicesshouted and talked at the same time so that ount ostov had not timeto signify his approval of them all and the group increased dispersedreformed and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall andto the big table ot only was ierres attempt to speak unsuccessfulbut he was rudely interrupted pushed aside and people turned away fromhim as from a common enemy his happened not because they weredispleased by the substance of his speech which had even been forgottenafter the many subsequent speeches but to animate it the crowd needed atangible object to love and a tangible object to hate ierre became thelatter any other orators spoke after the excited nobleman and all inthe same tone any spoke eloquently and with originalitylinka the editor of the ussian essenger who was recognized criesof author author were heard in the crowd said that hell must berepulsed by hell and that he had seen a child smiling at lightningflashes and thunderclaps but we will not be that childes yes at thunderclaps was repeated approvingly in the back rowsof the crowdhe crowd drew up to the large table at which sat grayhaired or baldseventyyearold magnates uniformed and besashed almost all of whomierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons or playingboston at the clubs ith an incessant hum of voices the crowd advancedto the table ressed by the throng against the high backs of thechairs the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two togetherhose standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastenedto supply it thers in that heat and crush racked their brains to findsome thought and hastened to utter it he old magnates whom ierreknew sat and turned to look first at one and then at another and theirfaces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it veryhot ierre however felt excited and the general desire to show thatthey were ready to go to all lengthswhich found expression in thetones and looks more than in the substance of the speechesinfected himtoo e did not renounce his opinions but felt himself in some way toblame and wished to justify himself only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrificeswhen we know what is needed said he trying to be heard above theother voicesne of the old men nearest to him looked round but his attention wasimmediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the tablees oscow will be surrendered he will be our expiation shoutedone mane is the enemy of mankind cried another llow me to speakentlemen you are crushing me t that moment ount

coupleshe mperor he mperor a sudden cry resounded through the halls andthe whole throng hurried to the entrancehe mperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines ofnobles very face expressed respectful awestruck curiosity ierrestood rather far off and could not hear all that the mperor said romwhat he did hear he understood that the mperor spoke of the dangerthreatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the oscownobility e was answered by a voice which informed him of theresolution just arrived atentlemen said the mperor with a quivering voicehere was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided so thatierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the mperor sayingwith emotion never doubted the devotion of the ussian nobles but today it hassurpassed my expectations  thank you in the name of the atherlandentlemen let us act ime is most precioushe mperor ceased speaking the crowd began pressing round him andrapturous exclamations were heard from all sideses most precious a royal word said ount ostov with a sob estood at the back and though he had heard hardly anything understoodeverything in his own wayrom the hall of the nobility the mperor went to that of the merchantshere he remained about ten minutes ierre was among those who saw himcome out from the merchants hall with tears of emotion in his eyes sbecame known later he had scarcely begun to address the merchantsbefore tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voicehen ierre saw the mperor he was coming out accompanied by twomerchants one of whom

kept repeatingur lives and propertytake them our ajestyierres one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he wasready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything e nowfelt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and soughtan opportunity of effacing it aving heard that ount amonov wasfurnishing a regiment ezukhov at once informed ostopchin that hewould give a thousand men and their maintenanceld ostov could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears andat once consented to etyas request and went himself to enter his nameext day the mperor left oscow he assembled nobles all took offtheir uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs and notwithout some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollmentfeeling amazed themselves at what they had done   apoleon began the war with ussia because he could not resist going toresden could not help having his head turned by the homage hereceived could not help donning a olish uniform and yielding to thestimulating influence of a une morning and could not refrain frombursts of anger in the presence of urakin and then of alashevlexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personallyinsulted arclay de olly tried to command the army in the best waybecause he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a greatcommander ostov charged the rench because he could not restrain hiswish for a gallop across a level field and in the same way theinnumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with theirpersonal characteristics habits circumstances and aims hey weremoved by fear or vanity rejoiced or were indignant reasoned imaginingthat they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free willbut they all were involuntary tools of history carrying on a workconcealed from them but comprehensible to us uch is the inevitablefate of men of action and the higher they stand in the social hierarchythe less are they freehe actors of  have long since left the stage their personalinterests have vanished leaving no trace and nothing remains of thattime but its historic resultsrovidence compelled all these men striving to attain personal aims tofurther the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at allexpectedneither apoleon nor lexander nor still less any of thosewho did the actual fightinghe cause of the destruction of the rench army in  is clear to usnow o one will deny that that cause was on the one hand its advanceinto the heart of ussia late in the season without any preparation fora winter campaign and on the other the character given to the war bythe burning of ussian towns and the hatred of the foe this arousedamong the ussian people ut no one at the time foresaw what now seemsso evident that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousandmenthe best in the world and led by the best generalcould bedestroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strengthand led by inexperienced commanders as the ussian army was ot onlydid no one see this but on the ussian side every effort was made tohinder the only thing that could save ussia while on the rench sidedespite apoleons experience and socalled military genius everyeffort was directed to pushing on to oscow at the end of the summerthat is to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destructionn historical works on the year  rench writers are very fond ofsaying that apoleon felt the danger of extending his line that hesought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at molenskand of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaignwas even then understood ussian authors are still fonder of telling usthat from the commencement of the campaign a cythian war plan wasadopted to lure apoleon into the depths of ussia and this plan someof them attribute to fuel others to a certain renchman others tooll and others again to lexander himselfpointing to notesprojects and letters which contain hints of such a line of action utall these hints at what happened both from the rench side and theussian are advanced only because they fit in with the event ad thatevent not occurred these hints would have been forgotten as we haveforgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to thecontrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because theevent falsified them here are always so many conjectures as to theissue of any event that however it may end there will always be peopleto say  said then that it would be so quite forgetting that amidtheir innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effectonjectures as to apoleons awareness of the danger of extending hisline and on the ussian side as to luring the enemy into the depthsof ussia are evidently of that kind and only by much straining canhistorians attribute such conceptions to apoleon and his marshals orsuch plans to the ussian commanders ll the facts are in flatcontradiction to such conjectures uring the whole period of the warnot only was there no wish on the ussian side to draw the rench intothe heart of the country but from their first entry into ussiaeverything was done to stop them nd not only was apoleon not afraidto extend his line but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph anddid not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns but very lazilyt the very beginning of the war our armies were divided and our soleaim was to unite them though uniting the armies was no advantage if wemeant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country urmperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of ussiansoil and not to retreat he enormous rissa camp was formed on fuelsplan and there was no intention of retiring farther he mperorreproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired e couldnot bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach molensk still lesscould he contemplate the burning of oscow and when our armies didunite he was displeased that molensk was abandoned and burned without ageneral engagement having been fought under its wallso thought the mperor and the ussian commanders and people were stillmore provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into thedepths of the countryapoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country andmissed several chances of forcing an engagement n ugust he was atmolensk and thought only of how to advance farther though as we nowsee that advance was evidently ruinous to himhe facts clearly show that apoleon did not foresee the danger of theadvance on oscow nor did lexander and the ussian commanders thenthink of luring apoleon on but quite the contrary he luring ofapoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any planfor no one believed it to be possible it resulted from a most complexinterplay of intrigues aims and wishes among those who took part inthe war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable or of the oneway of saving ussia verything came about fortuitously he armieswere divided at the commencement of the campaign e tried to unitethem with the evident intention of giving battle and checking theenemys advance and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battlewith a much stronger enemy and necessarily withdrawing the armies at anacute anglewe led the rench on to molensk ut we withdrew at anacute angle not only because the rench advanced between our two armiesthe angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther becausearclay de olly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by agration whowould come under his command and agrationbeing in command of thesecond armytried to postpone joining up and coming under arclayscommand as long as he could agration was slow in effecting thejunctionthough that was the chief aim of all at headquartersbecauseas he alleged he exposed his army to danger on this march and it wasbest for him to retire more to the left and more to the south worryingthe enemy from flank and rear and securing from the kraine recruits forhis army and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come underthe command of the detested foreigner arclay whose rank was inferiorto his ownhe mperor was with the army to encourage it but his presence andignorance of what steps to take and the enormous number of advisers andplans destroyed the first armys energy and it retiredhe intention was to make a stand at the rissa camp but aulucciaiming at becoming commanderinchief unexpectedly employed his energyto influence lexander and fuels whole plan was abandoned and thecommand entrusted to arclay ut as arclay did not inspire confidencehis power was limited he armies were divided there was no unity ofcommand and arclay was unpopular but from this confusion divisionand the unpopularity of the foreign commanderinchief there resultedon the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle which we couldnot have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone elseinstead of arclay been in command and on the other an everincreasingindignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zealt last the mperor left the army and as the most convenient and indeedthe only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessaryfor him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation ingeneral to a patriotic war nd by this visit of the mperor to oscowthe strength of the ussian army was treblede left in order not to obstruct the commanderinchiefs undividedcontrol of the army and hoping that more decisive action would then betaken but the command of the armies became still more confused andenfeebled ennigsen the sarevich and a swarm of adjutants generalremained with the army to keep the commanderinchief under observationand arouse his energy and arclay feeling less free than ever underthe observation of all these eyes of the mperor became still morecautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battlearclay stood for caution he sarevich hinted at treachery anddemanded a general engagement ubomirski ronnitski locki and theothers of that group stirred up so much trouble that arclay underpretext of sending papers to the mperor dispatched these olishadjutants general to etersburg and plunged into an open struggle withennigsen and the

now said he ouve made me quarrel with myson atisfied are you hats all you wanted atisfied t hurtsme it hurts m old and weak and this is what you wanted ell thengloat over it loat over itfter that rincess ary did not see her father for a whole week e wasill and did not leave his studyrincess ary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the oldprince not only excluded her from his room but did not admitademoiselle ourienne either ikhon alone attended himt the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former wayof life devoting himself with special activity to building operationsand the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off hisrelations with ademoiselle ourienne is looks and cold tone to hisdaughter seemed to say here you see ou plotted against me youlied to rince ndrew about my relations with that renchwoman and mademe quarrel with him but you see  need neither her nor yourincess ary spent half of every day with little icholas watching hislessons teaching him ussian and music herself and talking toessalles the rest of the day she spent over her books with her oldnurse or with ods folk who sometimes came by the back door to seeherf the war rincess ary thought as women do think about wars hefeared for her brother who was in it was horrified by and amazed at thestrange cruelty that impels men to kill one another but she did notunderstand the significance of this war which seemed to her like allprevious wars he did not realize the significance of this war thoughessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interestedin its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to herand though the ods folk who came to see her reported in their ownway the rumors current among the people of an invasion by ntichristand though ulie now rincess rubetskaya who had resumedcorrespondence with her wrote patriotic letters from oscow write you in ussian my good friend wrote ulie in her renchifiedussian because  have a detestation for all the rench and the samefor their language which  cannot support to hear spoken e inoscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored mperory poor husband is enduring pains and

live men make beautiful conversations over our charpieonly you my friend are missing and so onhe chief reason rincess ary did not realize the full significance ofthis war was that the old prince never spoke of it did not recognizeit and laughed at essalles when he mentioned it at dinner heprinces tone was so calm and confident that rincess aryunhesitatingly believed himll that uly the old prince was exceedingly active and even animatede planned another garden and began a new building for the domesticserfs he only thing that made rincess ary anxious about him was thathe slept very little and instead of sleeping in his study as usualchanged his sleeping place every day ne day he would order his campbed to be set up in the glass gallery another day he remained on thecouch or on the lounge

molensk the troops continued to retreat followed by the enemy nthe tenth of ugust the regiment rince ndrew commanded was marchingalong the highroad past the avenue leading to ald ills eat anddrought

forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness ut on theroad the highroad along which the troops marched there was no suchfreshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest thedew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inchesdeep s soon as day dawned the march began he artillery and baggagewagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the veryhubs of the wheels and the infantry sank ankledeep in that softchoking hot dust that never cooled even at night ome of this dust waskneaded by the feet and wheels while the rest rose and hung like acloud over the troops settling in eyes ears hair and nostrils andworst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along thatroad he higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust andthrough the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with nakedeye at the sun which showed like a huge crimson ball in the uncloudedsky here was no wind and the men choked in that motionlessatmosphere hey marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses andmouths hen they passed through a village they all rushed to the wellsand fought for the water and drank it down to the mudrince ndrew was in command of a regiment and the management of thatregiment the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving andgiving orders engrossed him he burning of molensk and itsabandonment made an epoch in his life  novel feeling of anger againstthe foe made him forget his own sorrow e was entirely devoted to theaffairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men andofficers n the regiment they called him our prince were proud ofhim and loved him ut he was kind and gentle only to those of hisregiment to imokhin and the likepeople quite new to him belongingto a different world and who could not know and understand his past ssoon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the staffhe bristled up immediately and grew spiteful ironical andcontemptuous verything that reminded him of his past was repugnant tohim and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himselfto trying to do his duty and not to be unfairn truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light torince ndrew especially after the abandonment of molensk on the sixthof ugust he considered that it could and should have been defendedand after his sick father had had to flee to oscow abandoning topillage his dearly beloved ald ills which he had built and peopledut despite this thanks to his regiment rince ndrew had something tothink about entirely apart from general questions wo days previouslyhe had received news that his father son and sister had left foroscow and though there was nothing for him to do at ald ills rincendrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided thathe must ride theree ordered his horse to be saddled and leaving his regiment on themarch rode to his fathers estate where he had been born and spent hischildhood iding past the pond where there used always to be dozens ofwomen chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with woodenbeetles rince ndrew noticed that there was not a soul about and thatthe little washing wharf torn from its place and half submerged wasfloating on its side in the middle of the pond e rode to the keeperslodge o one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the doorstood open rass had already begun to grow on the garden paths andhorses and calves were straying in the nglish park rince ndrew rodeup to the hothouse some of the glass panes were broken and of thetrees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up e called foraras the gardener but no one replied aving gone round the corner ofthe hothouse to the ornamental garden he saw that the carved gardenfence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off withthe fruit n old peasant whom rince ndrew in his childhood had oftenseen at the gate was sitting on a green garden

withered branch of a magnoliarince ndrew rode up to the house everal limes in the old garden hadbeen cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front ofthe house among the rosebushes he shutters were all closed except atone window which was open  little serf boy seeing rince ndrew raninto the house lpatych having sent his family away was alone at aldills and was sitting indoors reading the ives of the aints nhearing that rince ndrew had come he went out with his spectacles onhis nose buttoning his coat and hastily stepping up without a wordbegan weeping and kissing rince ndrews kneehen vexed at his own weakness he turned away and began to report onthe position of affairs verything precious and valuable had beenremoved to ogucharovo eventy quarters of grain had also been cartedaway he hay and the spring corn of which lpatych said there had beena remarkable crop that year had been commandeered by the troops andmown down while still green he peasants were ruined

the question to refer to their departure forogucharovo replied that they had left on the seventh and again wentinto details concerning the estate management asking for instructionsm  to let the troops have the oats and to take a receipt for theme have still six hundred quarters left he inquiredhat am  to say to him thought rince ndrew looking down on theold mans bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression onhis face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questionswere and only asked them to allay his griefes let them have it replied rince ndrewf you noticed some disorder in the garden said lpatych it wasimpossible to prevent it hree regiments have been here and spent thenight dragoons mostly  took down the name and rank of theircommanding officer to hand in a complaint about itell and what are you going to do ill you stay here if the enemyoccupies the place asked rince ndrewlpatych turned his face to rince ndrew looked at him and suddenlywith a solemn gesture raised his arme is my refuge is will be done he exclaimed group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow towardthe princeell goodby said rince ndrew bending over to lpatych ou mustgo away too take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to theyazan estate or to the one near oscowlpatych clung to rince ndrews leg and burst into sobs entlydisengaging himself the prince

with frightened look clutched her younger companion by thehand and hid with her behind a birch tree not stopping to pick up somegreen plums they had droppedrince ndrew turned away with startled haste unwilling to let them seethat they had been observed e was sorry for the pretty frightenedlittle girl was afraid of looking at her and yet felt an irresistibledesire to do so  new sensation of comfort and relief came over himwhen seeing these girls he realized the existence of other humaninterests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as thosethat occupied him vidently these girls passionately desired one thingto carry away and eat those green plums without being caughtandrince ndrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise ecould not resist looking at them once more elieving their danger pastthey sprang from their ambush and chirruping something in their shrilllittle voices and holding up their skirts their bare little sunburnedfeet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grassrince ndrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dustyhighroad along which the troops were moving ut not far from ald illshe again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its haltingplace by the dam of a small pond t was past one oclock he sun ared ball through the dust burned and scorched his back intolerablythrough his black coat he dust always hung motionless above the buzzof talk that came from the resting troops here was no wind s hecrossed the dam rince ndrew smelled the ooze and freshness of thepond e longed to get into that water however dirty it might be andhe glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks andlaughter he small muddy green pond had risen visibly more than afoot flooding the dam because it was full of the naked white bodies ofsoldiers with brickred hands necks and faces who were splashingabout in it ll this naked white human flesh laughing and shriekingfloundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a wateringcan and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass renderedit specially patheticne fairhaired young soldier of the third company whom rince ndrewknew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg crossed himselfstepped back to get a good run and plunged into the water another adark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy stood up to hiswaist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snortedwith satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with handsblackened to the wrists here were sounds of men slapping one anotheryelling and puffingverywhere on the bank on the dam and in the pond there was healthywhite muscular flesh he officer imokhin with his red little nosestanding on the dam wiping himself with a towel felt confused at seeingthe prince but made up his mind to address him neverthelessts very nice your excellency ouldnt you like to said hets dirty replied rince ndrew making a grimaceell clear it out for you in a minute said imokhin and stillundressed ran off to clear the men out of the pondhe prince wants to bathehat prince urs said many voices and the men were in such haste toclear out that the prince could hardly stop them e decided that hewould rather wash himself with water in the barnlesh bodies cannon fodder he thought and he looked at his ownnaked body and shuddered not from cold but from a sense of disgust andhorror he did not himself understand aroused by the sight of thatimmense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pondn the seventh of ugust rince agration wrote as follows from hisquarters at ikhaylovna on the molensk roadear ount lexis ndreeviche was writing to rakcheev but knew thathis letter would be read by the mperor and therefore weighed everyword in it to the best of his ability expect the inister arclay de olly has already reported theabandonment of molensk to the enemy t is pitiable and sad and thewhole army is in despair that this most important place has beenwantonly abandoned  for my part begged him personally most urgentlyand finally wrote him but nothing would induce him to consent  swearto you on my honor that apoleon was in such a fix as never before andmight have lost half his army but could not have taken molensk urtroops fought and are fighting as never before ith fifteen thousandmen  held the enemy at bay for thirtyfive hours and beat him but hewould not hold out even for fourteen hours t is disgraceful a stainon our army and as for him he ought it seems to me not to live fhe reports that our losses were great it is not true perhaps aboutfour thousand not more and not even that but even were they tenthousand thats war ut the enemy has lost masseshat would it have cost him to hold out for another two days hey wouldhave had to retire of their own accord for they had no water for men orhorses e gave me his word he would not retreat but suddenly sentinstructions that he was retiring that night e cannot fight in thisway or we may soon bring the enemy to oscowhere is a rumor that you are thinking of peace od forbid that youshould make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats ouwould set all ussia against you and every one of us would feel ashamedto wear the uniform f it has come to thiswe must fight as long asussia can and as long as there are men able to standne man ought to be in command and not two our inister may perhapsbe good as a inister but as a general he is not merely bad butexecrable yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country am really frantic with vexation forgive my writing boldly t is clearthat the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace and that theinister should command the army does not love our sovereign anddesires the ruin of us all o  write you frankly call out themilitia or the inister is leading these visitors after him to oscowin a most masterly way he whole army feels great suspicion of themperial aidedecamp olzogen e is said to be more apoleons manthan ours and he is always advising the inister  am not merely civilto him but obey him like a corporal though  am his senior his ispainful but loving my benefactor and sovereign  submit nly  amsorry for the mperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as heonsider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in thehospital more than fifteen thousand men and had we attacked this wouldnot have happened ell me for ods sake what will ussia our motherussia say to our being so frightened and why are we abandoning ourgood and gallant atherland to such rabble and implanting feelings ofhatred and shame in all our subjects hat are we scared at and of whomare we afraid  am not to blame that the inister is vacillating acoward dense dilatory and has all bad qualities he whole armybewails it and calls down curses upon him mong the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of humanlife one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails andthose in which form prevails o the latteras distinguished fromvillage country provincial or even oscow lifewe may allotetersburg life and especially the life of its salons hat life of thesalons is

all apoleons attempts at conciliation werediscussed n that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurriedpreparations for a removal to azan of the court and the girlseducational establishments under the patronage of the owager mpressn elenes circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formaldemonstrations which would very soon end in peace and the viewprevailed expressed by ilibinwho now in etersburg was quite at homein elenes house which every clever man was obliged to visitthat notby gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled nthat circle the oscow enthusiasmnews of which had reached etersburgsimultaneously with the mperors returnwas ridiculed sarcasticallyand very cleverly though with much cautionnna avlovnas circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasmand spoke of it as lutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients rinceasili who still occupied his former important posts formed aconnecting link between these two circles e visited his good friendnna avlovna as well as his daughters diplomatic salon and oftenin his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confusedand said at elenes what he should have said at nna avlovnas andvice versaoon after the mperors return rince asili in a conversation aboutthe war at nna avlovnas severely condemned arclay de olly but wasundecided as to who ought to be appointed commanderinchief ne of thevisitors usually spoken of as a man of great merit having describedhow he had that day seen utuzov the newly chosen chief of theetersburg militia presiding over the enrollment of recruits at thereasury cautiously ventured to suggest that utuzov would be the manto satisfy all requirementsnna avlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that utuzov had donenothing but cause the mperor annoyance have talked and talked at the ssembly of the obility rinceasili interrupted but they did not listen to me  told them hiselection as chief of the militia would not please the mperor hey didnot listen to mets all this mania for opposition he went on nd who for t isall because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those uscovitesrince asili continued forgetting for a moment that though at elenesone had to ridicule the oscow enthusiasm at nna avlovnas one had tobe ecstatic about it ut he retrieved his mistake at once ow is itsuitable that ount utuzov the oldest general in ussia shouldpreside at that tribunal e will get nothing for his pains ow couldthey make a man commanderinchief who cannot mount a horse who dropsasleep at a council and has the very worst morals  good reputation hemade for himself at ucharest  dont speak of his capacity as ageneral but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit blind oldman positively blind  fine idea to have a blind general e cant seeanything o play blindmans bluff e cant see at allo one replied to his remarkshis was quite correct on the twentyfourth of uly ut on the twentyninth of uly utuzov received the title of rince his might indicatea wish to get rid of him and therefore rince asilis opinioncontinued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to expressit ut on the eighth of ugust a committee consisting of ield arshalaltykov rakcheev yazmitinov opukhin and ochubey met to considerthe progress of the war his committee came to the conclusion that ourfailures were due to a want of unity in the command and though themembers of the committee were aware of the mperors dislike of utuzovafter a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment ascommander in chief hat same day utuzov was appointed commanderinchief with full powers over the armies and over the whole regionoccupied by themn the ninth of ugust rince asili at nna avlovnas again met theman of great merit he latter was very attentive to nna avlovnabecause he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educationalestablishments for young ladies rince asili entered the room with theair of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desiresell have you heard the great news rince utuzov is field marshalll dissensions are at an end  am so glad so delighted t last wehave a man said he glancing sternly and significantly round ateveryone in the drawing roomhe man of great merit despite his desire to obtain the post ofdirector could not refrain from reminding rince asili of his formeropinion hough this was impolite to rince asili in nna avlovnasdrawing room and also to nna avlovna herself who had received thenews with delight he could not resist the temptationut rince they say he is blind said he reminding rince asili ofhis own wordsh onsense e sees well enough said rince asili rapidly in adeep voice and with a slight coughthe voice and cough with which hewas wont to dispose of all difficultiese sees well enough he added nd what  am so pleased about hewent on is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all thearmies and the whole regionpowers no commanderinchief ever hadbefore e is a second autocrat he concluded with a victorious smileod grant it od grant it said nna avlovnahe man of great merit who was still a novice in court circleswishing to flatter nna avlovna by defending her former position onthis question observedt is said that the mperor was reluctant to give utuzov those powershey say he blushed like a girl to whom oconde is read when he said toutuzov our mperor and the atherland award you this honorerhaps the heart took no part in that speech said nna avlovnah no no warmly rejoined rince asili who would not now yieldutuzov to anyone in his opinion utuzov was not only admirablehimself but was adored by everybody o thats impossible said hefor our sovereign appreciated him so highly beforeod grant only that rince utuzov assumes real power and does notallow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel observed nna avlovnanderstanding at once to whom she alluded rince asili said in awhisper know for a fact that utuzov made it an absolute condition that thesarevich should not be with the army o you know what he said to themperornd rince asili repeated the words supposed to have been spoken byutuzov to the mperor  can neither punish him if he does wrong norreward him if he does righth a very wise man is rince utuzov  have known him a long timehey even say remarked the man of great merit who did not yetpossess courtly tact that his excellency made it an express conditionthat the sovereign himself should not be with the armys soon as he said this both rince asili and nna avlovna turned awayfrom him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naivete hile this was taking place in etersburg the rench had already passedmolensk and were drawing nearer and nearer to oscow apoleonshistorian hiers like other of his historians trying to justify hishero says that he was drawn to the walls of oscow against his will eis as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historicevents in the will of one man he is as right as the ussian historianswho maintain that apoleon was drawn to oscow by the skill of theussian commanders ere besides the law of retrospection which regardsall the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur thelaw of reciprocity comes in confusing the whole matter  goodchessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his lossresulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in theopening but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similarmistakes and that none of his moves were perfect e only notices themistake to which he pays attention because his opponent took advantageof it ow much more complex than this is the game of war which occursunder certain limits of time and where it is not one will thatmanipulates lifeless objects but everything results from innumerableconflicts of various willsfter molensk apoleon sought a battle beyond orogobuzh at yazma andthen at sarevoaymishche but it happened that owing to a

masterdinnerless had been whipped and sent to the village in quest ofchickens where he engaged in looting till the rench took him prisoneravrushka was one of those coarse barefaced lackeys who have seen allsorts of things consider it necessary to do everything in a mean andcunning way are ready to render any sort of service to their masterand are keen at guessing their masters baser impulses

utmost to gain his new masters favore knew very well that this was apoleon but apoleons presence couldno more intimidate him than ostovs or a sergeant majors with therods would have done for he had

thought they would beat onaparte or not avrushka screwed uphis eyes and consideredn this question he saw subtle cunning as men of his type see cunningin everything so he frowned and did not answer

smilingly interpreted this speech to apoleon thusf a battle takes place within the next three days the rench will winbut if later od knows what will happen apoleon did not smilethough he was evidently

assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to bewhipped s soon as apoleons interpreter had spoken says hiersthe ossack seized by amazement did not utter another word but rodeon his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him acrossthe steppes of the ast ll his loquacity was suddenly arrested andreplaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration apoleon aftermaking the ossack a

outposts inventing on the way all that had not taken place but thathe meant to relate to his comrades hat had really taken place he didnot wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling e foundthe ossacks inquired for the regiment operating with latovsdetachment and by evening found his master icholas ostov quarteredat ankovo ostov was just mounting to go for a ride round theneighboring villages with lyin he let avrushka have another horse andtook him along with him rincess ary was not in oscow and out of danger as rince ndrewsupposedfter the return of lpatych from molensk the old prince suddenlyseemed to awake as from a dream e ordered the militiamen to be calledup from the villages and armed and wrote a letter to the commanderinchief informing him that he had resolved to remain at ald ills to thelast extremity and to defend it leaving to the commanderinchiefsdiscretion to take measures or not for the defense of ald ills whereone of ussias oldest generals would be captured or killed and heannounced to his household that he would remain at ald illsut while himself remaining he gave instructions for the departure ofthe princess and essalles with the little prince to ogucharovo andthence to oscow rincess ary alarmed by her fathers feverish andsleepless activity after his previous apathy could not bring herself toleave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobeyhim he refused to go away and her fathers fury broke over her in aterrible storm e repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted onher rying to convict her he told her she had worn him out had causedhis quarrel with his son had harbored nasty suspicions of him makingit the object of her life to poison his existence and he drove her fromhis study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same tohim e declared that he did not wish to remember her existence andwarned her not to dare to let him see her he fact that he did not asshe had feared order her to be carried away by force but only told hernot to let him see her cheered rincess ary he knew it was a proofthat in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home andhad not gone awayhe morning after little icholas had left the old prince donned hisfull uniform and prepared to visit the commanderinchief is calechewas already at the door rincess ary saw him walk out of the house inhis uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review hisarmed peasants and domestic serfs he sat by the window listening tohis voice which reached her from the garden uddenly several men camerunning up the avenue with frightened facesrincess ary ran out to the porch down the flowerbordered path andinto the avenue  large crowd of militiamen and domestics were movingtoward her and in their midst several men were supporting by thearmpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform anddecorations he ran up to him and in the play of the sunlight thatfell in small round spots through the shade of the limetree avenuecould not be sure what change there was in his face ll she could seewas that his former stern and determined expression had altered to oneof timidity and submission n seeing his daughter he moved his helplesslips and made a hoarse sound t was impossible to make out what hewanted e was lifted up carried to his study and laid on the verycouch he had so feared of latehe doctor who was fetched that same night bled him and said that theprince had had a seizure paralyzing his right sidet was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at ald ills andnext day they moved the prince to ogucharovo the doctor accompanyinghimy the time they reached ogucharovo essalles and the little princehad already left for oscowor three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the newhouse rince ndrew had built at ogucharovo ever in the same stategetting neither better nor worse e was unconscious and lay like adistorted corpse e muttered unceasingly his eyebrows and lipstwitching and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what wasgoing on around him or not ne thing was certainthat he was sufferingand wished to say something ut what it was no one could tell itmight be some caprice of a sick and halfcrazy man or it might relateto public affairs or possibly to family concernshe doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due tophysical causes but rincess ary thought he wished to tell hersomething and the fact that her presence always increased hisrestlessness confirmed her opinione was evidently suffering both physically and mentally here was nohope of recovery t was impossible for him to travel it would not doto let him die on the road ould it not be better if the end did comethe very end rincess ary sometimes thought ight and day hardlysleeping at all she watched him and terrible to say often watched himnot with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to findsymptoms of the approach of the endtrange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself yetthere it was nd what seemed still more terrible to her was that sinceher fathers illness began perhaps even sooner when she stayed withhim expecting something to happen all the personal desires and hopesthat had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened houghtsthat had not entered her mind for yearsthoughts of a life free fromthe fear of her father and even the possibility of love and of familyhappinessfloated continually in her imagination like temptations ofthe devil hrust them aside as she would questions continuallyrecurred to her as to how she would order her life now after thathese were temptations of the devil and rincess ary knew it he knewthat the sole weapon against him was prayer and she tried to pray heassumed an attitude of prayer looked at the icons repeated the wordsof a prayer but she could not pray he felt that a different world hadnow taken possession of herthe life of a world of strenuous and freeactivity quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she hadbeen confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer hecould not pray could not weep and worldly cares took possession ofhert was becoming dangerous to remain in ogucharovo ews of the approachof the rench came from all sides and in one village ten miles fromogucharovo a homestead had been looted by rench maraudershe doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince theprovincial arshal of the obility sent an official to rincess ary topersuade her to get away as quickly as possible and the head of therural police having come to ogucharovo urged the same thing sayingthat the rench were only some twentyfive miles away that renchproclamations were circulating in the villages and that if the princessdid not take her father away before the fifteenth he could not answerfor the consequenceshe princess decided to leave on the fifteenth he cares of preparationand giving orders for which everyone came to her occupied her all dayhe spent the night of the fourteenth as usual without undressing inthe room next to the one where the prince lay everal times waking upshe heard his groans and muttering the creak of his bed and the stepsof ikhon and the doctor when they turned him over everal times shelistened at the door and it seemed to her that his mutterings werelouder than usual and that they turned him over oftener he could notsleep and several times went to the door and listened wishing to enterbut not deciding to do so hough he did not speak rincess ary sawand knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to himhe had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look shesometimes involuntarily fixed on him he knew that her going in duringthe night at an unusual hour would irritate himut never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losinghim he recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of hisfound an expression of his love of her ccasionally amid these memoriestemptations of the devil would surge into her imagination thoughts ofhow things would be after his death and how her new liberated lifewould be ordered ut she drove these thoughts away with disgust owardmorning he became quiet and she fell asleephe woke late hat sincerity which often comes with waking showed herclearly what chiefly concerned her about her fathers illness n wakingshe listened to what was going on behind the door and hearing himgroan said to herself with a sigh that things were still the sameut what could have happened hat did  want  want his death shecried with a feeling of loathing for herselfhe washed dressed said her prayers and went out to the porch nfront of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packedinto the vehiclest was a warm gray morning rincess ary stopped at the porch stillhorrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughtsbefore going

sprays ofjuniper a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head and in acorner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalmsust as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse so theinmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room roundthe coffinthe arshal the village lder peasant womenand all withfixed and frightened eyes crossing themselves bowed and kissed the oldprinces cold and stiffened hand ntil rince ndrew settled in ogucharovo its owners had always beenabsentees and its peasants were of quite a different character fromthose of ald ills hey differed from them in speech dress anddisposition hey were called steppe peasants he old prince used toapprove of them for their endurance at work when they came to ald illsto help with the harvest or to dig ponds and ditches but he dislikedthem for their boorishnessrince ndrews last stay at ogucharovo when he introduced hospitalsand schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay had notsoftened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in themthe traits of character the old prince called boorishness ariousobscure rumors were always current among them at one time a rumor thatthey would all be enrolled as ossacks at another of a new religion towhich they were all to be converted then of some proclamation of thesars and of an oath to the sar aul in  in connection with whichit was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners hadstopped it then of eter edorovichs return to the throne in sevenyears time when everything would be made free and so simple thatthere would be no restrictions umors of the war with onaparte and hisinvasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vaguenotions of ntichrist the end of the world and pure freedomn the vicinity of ogucharovo were large villages belonging to thecrown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where theypleased here were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood andalso very few domestic or literate serfs and in the lives of thepeasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of theussian people the causes and meaning of which are so baffling tocontemporaries were more clearly and strongly noticeable than amongothers ne instance which had occurred some twenty years before was amovement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown warm riversundreds of peasants among them the ogucharovo folk suddenly beganselling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeasts birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea so these men with theirwives and children streamed to the southeast to parts where none ofthem had ever been hey set off in caravans bought their freedom oneby one or ran away and drove or walked toward the warm rivers anyof them were punished some sent to iberia many died of cold andhunger on the road many returned of their own accord and the movementdied down of itself just as it had sprung up without apparent reasonut such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered newforces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely unexpectedly andat the same time simply naturally and forcibly ow in  to anyoneliving in close touch with these people it was apparent that theseundercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruptionlpatych who had reached ogucharovo shortly before the old princesdeath noticed an agitation among the peasants and that contrary towhat was happening in the ald ills district where over a radius offorty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villagesto be devastated by the ossacks the peasants in the steppe regionround ogucharovo were it was rumored in touch with the renchreceived leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand and did notmigrate e learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasantarp who possessed great influence in the village commune and hadrecently been away driving a government transport had returned withnews that the ossacks were destroying deserted villages but that therench did not harm them lpatych also knew that on the previous dayanother peasant had even brought from the village of isloukhovo whichwas occupied by the rench a proclamation by a rench general that noharm would be done to the inhabitants and if they remained they wouldbe paid for anything taken from them s proof of this the peasant hadbrought from isloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes he did not know thatthey were false paid to him in advance for hayore important still lpatych learned that on the morning of the veryday he gave the village lder orders to collect carts to move theprincess luggage from ogucharovo there had been a village meeting atwhich it had been decided not to move but to wait et there was no timeto waste n the fifteenth the day of the old princes death thearshal had insisted on rincess arys leaving at once as it wasbecoming dangerous e had told her that after the sixteenth he couldnot be responsible for what might happen n the evening of the day theold prince died the arshal went away promising to return next day forthe funeral ut this he was unable to do for he received tidings thatthe rench had unexpectedly advanced and had barely time to remove hisown family and valuables from his estateor some thirty years ogucharovo had been managed by the village lderron whom the old prince called by the diminutive ronushkaron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who growbig beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they aresixty or seventy without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth asstraight and strong at sixty as at thirtyoon after the migration to the warm rivers in which he had takenpart like the rest ron was made village lder and overseer ofogucharovo and had since filled that post irreproachably for twentythree years he peasants feared him more than they did their masterhe masters both the old prince and the young and the stewardrespected him and jestingly called him the inister uring the wholetime of his service ron had never been drunk or ill never aftersleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigueand though he could not read he had never forgotten a single moneyaccount or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endlesscartloads he sold for the prince nor a single shock of the whole corncrop on any single acre of the ogucharovo fieldslpatych arriving from the devastated ald ills estate sent for hisron on the day of the princes funeral and told him to have twelvehorses got ready for the princess carriages and eighteen carts for thethings to be removed from ogucharovo hough the peasants paidquitrent lpatych thought no difficulty would be made about complyingwith this order for there were two hundred and thirty households atwork in ogucharovo and the peasants were well to do ut on hearing theorder ron lowered his eyes and remained silent lpatych named certainpeasants he knew from whom he told him to take the cartsron replied that the horses of these peasants were away cartinglpatych named others but they too according to ron had no horsesavailable some horses were carting for the government others were tooweak and others had died for want of fodder t seemed that no horsescould be had even for the carriages much less for the cartinglpatych looked intently at ron and frowned ust as ron was a modelvillage lder so lpatych had not managed the princes estates fortwenty years in vain e was a model steward possessing in the highestdegree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealtwith aving glanced at ron he at once understood that his answers didnot express his personal views but the general mood of the ogucharovocommune by which the lder had already been carried away ut he alsoknew that ron who had acquired property and was hated by the communemust be hesitating between the two camps the masters and the serfse noticed this hesitation in rons look and therefore frowned andmoved closer up to himow just listen ronushka said he ont talk nonsense to me isexcellency rince ndrew himself gave me orders to move all the peopleaway and not leave them with the enemy and there is an order from thesar about it too nyone who stays is a traitor to the sar o youhear hear ron answered without lifting his eyeslpatych was not satisfied with this replyh ron it will turn out badly he said shaking his headhe power is in your hands ron rejoined sadlyh ron drop it lpatych repeated withdrawing his hand from hisbosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at rons feet  can seethrough you and three yards into the ground under you he continuedgazing at the floor in front of ronron was disconcerted glanced furtively at lpatych and again loweredhis eyesou drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave theirhomes and go to oscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning forthe princess

through you and three yardsunder you he repeated knowing that his skill in beekeeping hisknowledge of the right time to sow the oats and the fact that he hadbeen able to retain the old princes favor for twenty years had longsince gained him the reputation of being a wizard and that the power ofseeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizardsron got up and was about to say something but lpatych interruptedhimhat is it you have got into your heads eh hat are you thinkingof ehhat am  to do with the people said ron heyre quite besidethemselves  have already told themold them  dare say said lpatych re they drinking he askedabruptlyuite beside themselves akov lpatych theyve fetched anotherbarrelell then listen ll go to the police officer and you tell themso and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready understandlpatych did not insist further e had managed people for a long timeand knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicionthat they can possibly disobey aving wrung a submissive  understandfrom ron lpatych contented himself with that though he not onlydoubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops thecarts would not be forthcomingnd so it was for when evening came no carts had been provided n thevillage outside the drink shop another meeting was being held whichdecided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and thecarts should not be provided ithout saying anything of this to theprincess lpatych had his own belongings taken out of the carts whichhad arrived from ald ills and had those horses got ready for theprincess carriages eanwhile he went himself to the policeauthorities fter her fathers funeral rincess ary shut herself up in her room anddid not admit anyone  maid came to the door to say that lpatych wasasking for orders about their departure his was before his talk withron rincess ary raised herself on the sofa on which she had beenlying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to goaway and begged to be left in peacehe windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward he layon the sofa with her face to the wall fingering the buttons of theleather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion and her confusedthoughts were centered on one subjectthe irrevocability of death andher own spiritual baseness which she had not suspected but which hadshown itself during her fathers illness he wished to pray but did notdare to dared not in her present state of mind address herself to odhe lay for a long time in that positionhe sun had reached the other side of the house and its slanting raysshone into the open window lighting up the room and part of the moroccocushion at which rincess ary was looking he flow of her thoughtssuddenly stopped nconsciously she sat up smoothed her hair got upand went to the window involuntarily inhaling the freshness of theclear but windy eveninges you can well enjoy the evening

her head he looked up t was ademoiselle ourienne in a blackdress and weepers he softly approached rincess ary sighed kissedher and immediately began to cry he princess looked up at her lltheir former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind utshe remembered too how he had changed of late toward ademoiselleourienne and could not bear to see her thereby showing how unjust werethe reproaches rincess ary had mentally addressed to her esides isit for me for me who desired his death to condemn anyone shethoughtrincess ary vividly pictured to herself the position of ademoiselleourienne whom she had of late kept at a distance but who yet wasdependent on her and living in her house he felt sorry for her andheld out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry ademoiselleourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand speaking ofthe princess sorrow and making herself a partner in it he said heronly consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share hersorrow that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing butthis great grief that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyoneand that he from above saw her affection and gratitude he princessheard her not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her andlistening to the sound of her voiceour position is doubly terrible dear princess said ademoiselleourienne after a pause  understand that you could not and cannotthink of yourself but with my love for you  must do so aslpatych been to you as he spoken to you of going away she askedrincess ary did not

arie to fall into the handsof the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terribleademoiselle ourienne took from her reticule a proclamation notprinted on ordinary ussian paper of eneral ameaus telling peoplenot to leave their homes and that the rench authorities would affordthem proper protection he handed this to the princess think it would be best to appeal to that general she continuedand  am sure that all due respect would be shown yourincess ary read the paper and her face began to quiver with stifledsobsrom whom did you get this she askedhey probably recognized that  am rench by my name repliedademoiselle ourienne blushingrincess ary with the paper in her hand rose from the window and witha pale face went out of the room and into what had been rince

paced the room sending now for ichaelvanovich and now for ikhon or ron unyasha the nurse and the othermaids could not say in how far ademoiselle ouriennes statement wascorrect lpatych was not at home he had gone to the police eithercould the architect ichael vanovich who on being sent for came inwith sleepy eyes tell rincess ary anything ith just the same smileof agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed toanswer the old prince without expressing views of his own he nowreplied to rincess ary so that nothing definite could be got from hisanswers he old valet ikhon with sunken emaciated face that bore thestamp of inconsolable grief replied es rincess to all rincessarys questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at hert length ron the village lder entered the room and with a deep bowto rincess ary came to a halt by the doorpostrincess ary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of himronushka she said regarding as a sure friend this

do all  cano rincess ary it was strange that now at a moment when such sorrowwas filling her soul there could be rich people and poor and the richcould refrain from helping the poor he had heard vaguely that therewas such a thing as landlords corn which was sometimes given to thepeasants he also knew that neither her father nor her brother wouldrefuse to help the peasants in need she only feared to make somemistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished togive he was glad such cares presented themselves enabling her withoutscruple to forget her own grief he began asking ron about thepeasants needs and what there was in ogucharovo that belonged to thelandlordut we have grain belonging to my brother she saidhe landlords grain is all safe replied ron proudly ur

the crowdstanding on the pasture by the barnhe men crowded closer together stirred and rapidly took off theirhats rincess ary lowered her eyes and tripping over her skirt cameclose up to them o many different eyes old and young were fixed onher and there were so many different faces that she could notdistinguish any of them and feeling that she must speak to them all atonce did not know how to do it ut again the sense that sherepresented her father and her brother gave her courage and she boldlybegan her speech am very glad you have come she said without raising her eyes andfeeling her heart beating quickly and violently ronushka tells methat the war has ruined you hat is our common misfortune and  shallgrudge nothing to help you  am myself going away because it isdangerous here the enemy

brotherand his songain she paused o one broke the silenceurs is a common misfortune and we will share it together ll that ismine is yours she concluded scanning the faces before herll eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression he couldnot fathom whether it was curiosity devotion gratitude orapprehension and distrustbut the expression on all the faces wasidenticale are all very thankful for your bounty but it wont do for us totake the landlords grain said a voice at the back of the crowdut why not asked the princesso one replied and rincess ary looking round at the crowd found thatevery eye she met now was immediately droppedut why dont you want to take it she asked againo one answeredhe silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catchsomeones eyehy dont you speak she inquired of a very old man who stood just infront of her leaning on his stick f you think something more iswanted tell me  will do anything said she catching his eyeut as if this angered him he bent his head quite low and mutteredhy should we agree e dont want the grainhy should we give up everything e dont agree ont agree eare sorry for you but were not willing o away yourself alonecame from various sides of the crowdnd again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expressionthough now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitudebut of angry resolveut you cant have understood me said rincess ary with a sad smilehy dont you want to go  promise to house and feed you while herethe enemy would ruin youut her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowdere not willing et them ruin us e wont take your grain e dontagreegain rincess ary tried to catch someones eye but not a single eyein the crowd was turned to her evidently they were all trying to avoidher look he felt strange and awkwardh yes an artful tale ollow her into slavery ull down your housesand go into bondage  dare say ll give you grain indeed shesays voices in the crowd were heard sayingith drooping head rincess ary left the crowd and went back to thehouse aving repeated her order to ron to have horses ready for herdeparture next morning she went to her room and remained alone with herown thoughts or a long time that night rincess ary sat by the open window of herroom hearing the sound of the peasants voices that reached her from thevillage but it was not of them she was thinking he felt that shecould not understand them however much she might think about them hethought only of one thing her sorrow which after the break caused bycares for the present seemed already to belong to the past ow shecould remember it and weep or prayfter sunset the wind had dropped he night was calm and fresh owardmidnight the voices began to subside a cock crowed the full moon beganto show from behind the lime trees a fresh white dewy mist began torise and stillness reigned over the village and the houseictures of the near pasther fathers illness and last momentsroseone after another to her memory ith mournful pleasure she now lingeredover these images repelling with horror only the last one the pictureof his death which she felt she could not contemplate even inimagination at this still and mystic hour of night nd these picturespresented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that theyseemed now present now past and now futurehe vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and wasbeing dragged along by his armpits through the garden at ald illsmuttering something with his helpless tongue twitching his grayeyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at herven then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died shethought e had always thought what he said then nd she recalled inall its detail the night at ald ills before he had the last strokewhen with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against hiswill he had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe and goingto the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listenedat the door n a suffering and weary voice he was saying something toikhon speaking of the rimea and its warm nights and of the mpressvidently he had wanted to talk nd why didnt he call me hy didnthe let me be there instead of ikhon rincess ary had thought andthought again now ow he will never tell anyone what he had in hissoul ever will that moment return for him or for me when he might havesaid all he longed to say and not ikhon but  might have heard andunderstood him hy didnt  enter the room she thought erhaps hewould then have said to me what he said the day he died hile talkingto ikhon he asked about me twice e wanted to see me and  wasstanding close by outside the door t was sad and painful for him totalk to ikhon who did not understand him  remember how he beganspeaking to him about ise as if she were alivehe had forgotten shewas deadand ikhon reminded him that she was no more and he shoutedool e was greatly depressed rom behind the door  heard how helay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed y od hy didnt go in then hat could he have done to me hat could  have lost ndperhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that wordto me nd rincess ary uttered aloud the caressing word he had saidto her on the day of his death earest she repeated and begansobbing with tears that relieved her soul he now saw his face beforeher nd not the face she had known ever since she could remember andhad always seen at a distance but the timid feeble face she had seenfor the first time quite closely with all its wrinkles and detailswhen she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he saidearest she repeated againhat was he thinking when he uttered that word hat is he thinkingnow his question suddenly presented itself to her and in answer shesaw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay inhis coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief nd thehorror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herselfthat that was not he but something mysterious and horrible seized heragain he tried to think of something else and to pray but could doneither ith wideopen eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadowsexpecting every moment to see his dead face and she felt that thesilence brooding over the house and within it held her fastunyasha she whispered unyasha she screamed wildly and tearingherself out of this silence she ran to the servants quarters to meether old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her n the seventeenth of ugust ostov and lyin

estate and threaten to unharness herhorses so that though everything has been packed up since morning herexcellency cannot get awaympossible exclaimed ostov have the honor to report to you the actual truth said lpatychostov dismounted gave his horse to the orderly and followed lpatychto the house questioning him as to the state of affairs t appearedthat the princess offer of corn to the peasants the previous day andher talk with ron and at the meeting had actually had so bad an effectthat ron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and hadnot appeared when lpatych sent for him and that in the morning whenthe princess gave orders to harness for her journey the peasants hadcome in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not lether leave the village that there was an order not to move and thatthey would unharness the horses lpatych had gone out to admonish thembut was told it was chiefly arp who did the talking ron not showinghimself in the crowd that they could not let the princess go thatthere was an order to the contrary but that if she stayed they wouldserve her as before and obey her in everythingt the moment when ostov and lyin were galloping along the roadrincess ary despite the dissuasions of lpatych her nurse and themaids had given orders to harness and intended to start but when thecavalrymen were espied they were taken for renchmen the coachman ranaway and the women in the house began to wailather enefactor od has sent you exclaimed deeply moved voices asostov passed through the anteroomrincess ary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sittingroom when ostov was shown in he could not grasp who he was and whyhe had come or what was happening to her hen she saw his ussianface and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as aman of her own class she glanced at him with her deep radiant look andbegan speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion hismeeting immediately struck ostov as a romantic event  helpless girloverwhelmed with grief left to the mercy of coarse rioting peasantsnd what a strange fate sent me here hat gentleness and nobility thereare in her features and expression thought he as he looked at her andlistened to her timid storyhen she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after herfathers funeral her voice trembled he turned away and then as iffearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity looked athim with an apprehensive glance of inquiry here were tears in ostovseyes rincess ary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with thatradiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten cannot express rincess how glad  am that  happened to ride hereand am able to show my readiness to serve you said ostov rising owhen you please and  give you my word of honor that no one shall dareto cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escortnd bowing respectfully as if to a lady of royal blood

upon herrincess ary understood this and appreciated his delicacy am very very grateful to you she said in rench but  hope itwas all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it hesuddenly began to cryxcuse me she saidostov knitting his brows left the room with another low bow ell is she pretty h friendmy pink one is delicious her name isunyashaut on glancing at ostovs face lyin stopped

continued to impart his views e said thepeasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would beimprudent to overresist them without an armed force and would it notbe better first to send for the militaryll give them armed force ll overresist them uttered ostovmeaninglessly breathless with irrational animal fury and the need tovent itithout considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quickresolute steps toward the crowd nd the nearer he drew to it the morelpatych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good resultshe peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they sawostovs rapid firm steps and resolute frowning facefter the hussars had come to the village and ostov had gone to see theprincess a certain confusion and dissension had arisen

the whole expression of her face radiant with gratitude andtenderness he could not believe that there was nothing to thank himfor n the contrary it seemed to her certain that had he not beenthere she

expression of mingled joy and sorrowell supposing  do love him thought rincess aryshamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen inlove with a man who would perhaps never love her she comforted herselfwith the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would notbe to blame if without ever speaking of it to anyone she continued tothe end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love forthe first and last time in her lifeometimes when she recalled his looks his sympathy and his wordshappiness did not appear impossible to her t was at those moments

mybrother nd in all this rincess ary saw the hand of rovidencehe impression the princess made on ostov was a very agreeable one oremember her gave him pleasure and when his comrades hearing of hisadventure at ogucharovo rallied him on having gone to look for hay andhaving picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in ussia he grewangry t made him angry just because the idea of marrying the

and he againpressed rince ndrews handrince ndrew knew enisov from what atasha had told him of her firstsuitor his memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painfulfeelings of which he had not thought lately but which still found placein his soul f late he had received so many new and very seriousimpressionssuch as the retreat from molensk his visit to ald illsand the recent news of his fathers deathand had experienced so manyemotions that for a long time past those memories had not entered hismind and now that they did they did not act on him with nearly theirformer strength or enisov too the memories awakened by the name ofolkonski belonged to a distant romantic past when after supper andafter atashas singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteenwithout realizing what he was doing e smiled at the recollection ofthat time and of his love for atasha and passed at once to what nowinterested him passionately and exclusively his was a plan of campaignhe had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat e hadproposed that plan to arclay de olly and now wished to propose it toutuzov he plan was based on the fact that the rench line ofoperation was too extended and it proposed that instead of orconcurrently with action on the front to bar the advance of the renchwe should attack their line of communication e began explaining hisplan to rince

gesticulating as he explained his plan toolkonski n the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from thearmy growing more incoherent and more diffused mingling with music andsongs and coming from the field where the review was held ounds ofhoofs and shouts were nearing the villagees coming es coming shouted a ossack standing at the gateolkonski and enisov moved to the gate at which a knot of soldiers aguard of honor was standing and they saw utuzov coming down thestreet mounted on a rather small sorrel horse  huge suite of generalsrode behind him arclay was riding almost beside him and a crowd ofofficers ran after and around them shouting urrahis adjutants galloped into the yard before him utuzov was impatientlyurging on his horse which ambled smoothly under his weight and heraised his hand to his white orse uards cap with a red band and nopeak nodding his head continually hen he came up to the guard ofhonor a fine set of renadiers mostly wearing decorations who weregiving him the salute he looked at them silently and attentively fornearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned tothe crowd of generals and officers surrounding him uddenly his faceassumed a subtle expression he shrugged his shoulders with an air ofperplexitynd with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat ell goodbyeneral he added and rode into the yard past rince ndrew andenisovurrah hurrah hurrah shouted those behind himince rince ndrew had last seen him utuzov had grown still morecorpulent flaccid and fat ut the bleached eyeball the scar and thefamiliar weariness of his expression were still the same e was wearingthe white orse uards cap and a military overcoat with a whip hangingover his shoulder by a thin strap e sat heavily and swayed limply onhis brisk little horsehew whew whew he whistled just audibly as he rode into theyard is face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man whomeans to rest after a ceremony e drew his left foot out of the stirrupand lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with theeffort raised it with difficulty onto the saddle leaned on his kneegroaned and slipped down into the arms of the ossacks and adjutantswho stood ready to assist hime pulled himself together looked round screwing up his eyes glancedat rince ndrew and evidently not recognizing him moved with hiswaddling gait to the porch hew whew whew he whistled andagain glanced at rince ndrew s often occurs with old men it wasonly after some seconds that the impression produced by rince ndrewsface linked itself up with utuzovs remembrance of his personalityh how do you do my dear prince ow do you do my dear boy omealong said he glancing wearily round and he stepped onto the porchwhich creaked under his weighte unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porchnd hows your father received news of his death yesterday replied rince ndrewabruptlyutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took offhis cap and crossed himselfay the kingdom of eaven be his ods will be done to us all esighed deeply his whole chest heaving and was silent for a while loved him and respected him and sympathize with you with all my hearte embraced rince ndrew pressing him to his fat breast and for sometime did not let him go hen he released him rince ndrew saw thatutuzovs flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes esighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himselfome ome with me well have a talk said heut at that moment enisov no more intimidated by his superiors than bythe enemy came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch despitethe angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him utuzov hishands still pressed on the seat glanced at him glumly enisov havinggiven his name announced that he had to communicate to his ereneighness a matter of great importance for their countrys welfareutuzov looked wearily at him and lifting his hands with a gesture ofannoyance folded them across his stomach repeating the words or ourcountrys welfare ell what is it peak enisov blushed like a girlit was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy bibulous timeworn face and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemyslines of communication between molensk and yazma enisov came fromthose parts and knew the country well is plan seemed decidedly a goodone especially from the strength of conviction with which he spokeutuzov looked down at his own legs occasionally glancing at the doorof the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge fromit nd from that hut while enisov was speaking a general with aportfolio under his arm really did appearhat said utuzov in the midst of enisovs explanations are youready so sooneady your erene ighness replied the generalutuzov swayed his head as much as to say ow is one man to deal withit all and again listened to enisov give my word of honor as a ussian officer said enisov that can bweak apoleons line of communicationhat relation are you to ntendant eneral iril ndreevich enisovasked utuzov interrupting hime is my uncle your ewene ighnessh we were friends said utuzov cheerfully ll right all rightfriend stay here at the staff and tomorrow well have a talkith a nod to enisov he turned away and put out his hand for the papersonovnitsyn had brought himould not your erene ighness like to come inside said the generalon duty in a discontented voice the plans must be examined and severalpapers have to be signedn adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readinesswithin ut utuzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till hewas disengaged e made a grimaceo tell them to bring a small table out here my dear boy ll lookat them here said he ont go away he added turning to rincendrew who remained in the porch and listened to the generals reporthile this was being given rince ndrew heard the whisper of a womansvoice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door everal times onglancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump rosy handsomewoman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head holding adish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commanderinchiefutuzovs adjutant whispered to rince ndrew that this was the wife ofthe priest whose home it was and that she intended to offer his ereneighness bread and salt er husband has welcomed his erene ighnesswith the cross at the church and she intends to welcome him in thehouse hes very pretty added the adjutant with a smile t thosewords utuzov looked round e was listening to the generals reportwhich consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at sarevoaymishcheas he had listened to enisov and seven years previouslyhad listened to the discussion at the usterlitz council of war eevidently listened only because he had ears which though there was apiece of tow in one of them could not help hearing but it was evidentthat nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest himthat he knew all that would be said beforehand and heard it all onlybecause he had to as one has to listen to the chanting of a service ofprayer ll that enisov had said was clever and to the point hat thegeneral was saying was even more clever and to the point but it wasevident that utuzov despised knowledge and cleverness and knew ofsomething else that would decide the mattersomething independent ofcleverness and knowledge rince ndrew watched the commanderinchiefsface attentively and the only expression he could see there was one ofboredom curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behindthe door and a desire to observe propriety t was evident that utuzovdespised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown byenisov but despised them not because of his own intellect feelingsor knowledgehe did not try to display any of thesebut because ofsomething else e despised them because of his old age and experienceof life he only instruction utuzov gave of his own accord during thatreport referred to looting by the ussian troops t the end of thereport the general put before him for signature a paper relating to therecovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by thesoldiers when landowners lodged petitions for compensationfter hearing the matter utuzov smacked his lips together and shookhis headnto the stove into the fire with it  tell you once for all mydear fellow said he into the fire with all such things et them cutthe crops and burn wood to their hearts content  dont order it orallow it but  dont exact compensation either ne cant get onwithout it hen wood is chopped the chips will fly e looked at thepaper again h this erman precision he muttered shaking his head ell thats all said utuzov as he signed the last of the documentsand rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck hemoved toward the door with a more cheerful expressionhe priests wife flushing rosy red caught up the dish she had afterall not managed to present at the right moment though she had so longbeen preparing for it and with a low bow offered it to utuzove screwed up his eyes smiled lifted her chin with his hand and saidh what a beauty hank you sweethearte took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on thedish for her ell my dear and how are we getting on he askedmoving to the door of the room assigned to him he priests wifesmiled and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the roomhe adjutant came out to the porch and asked rince ndrew to lunch withhim alf an hour later rince ndrew was again called to utuzov efound him reclining in an armchair still in the same unbuttonedovercoat e had in his hand a rench book which he closed as rincendrew entered marking the place with a knife rince ndrew saw by thecover that it was es hevaliers du ygne by adame de enlisell sit down sit down here ets have a talk said utuzov tssad very sad ut remember my dear fellow that  am a father to youa second fatherrince ndrew told utuzov all he knew of his fathers death and whathe had seen at ald ills when he passed through ithat what they have brought us to utuzov suddenly cried in anagitated voice evidently picturing vividly to himself from rincendrews story the condition ussia was in ut give me time give metime he said with a grim look evidently not wishing to continue thisagitating conversation and added  sent for you to keep you with me thank your erene ighness but  fear  am no longer fit for thestaff replied rince ndrew with a smile which utuzov noticedutuzov glanced inquiringly at himut above all added rince ndrew  have grown used to my regimentam fond of the officers and  fancy the men also like me  should besorry to leave the regiment f  decline the honor of being with youbelieve me shrewd kindly yet subtly derisive expression lit up utuzovs podgyface e cut olkonski short am sorry for  need you ut youre right youre right ts nothere that men are needed dvisers are always plentiful but men arenot he regiments would not be what they are if the wouldbe advisersserved there as you do  remember you at usterlitz  rememberyes  remember you with the standard said utuzov and a flush ofpleasure suffused rince ndrews face at this recollectionaking his hand and drawing him downwards utuzov offered his cheek tobe kissed and again rince ndrew noticed tears in the old mans eyeshough rince ndrew knew that utuzovs tears came easily and that hewas particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to showsympathy with his loss yet this reminder of usterlitz was bothpleasant and flattering to himo your way and od be with you  know your path is the path ofhonor e paused  missed you at ucharest but  needed someone tosend nd changing the subject utuzov began to speak of the urkishwar and the peace that had been concluded es  have been muchblamed he said both for that war and the peace but everythingcame at the right time out vient a point a celui qui sait attendre nd there were as many advisers there as here he went on returningto the subject of advisers which evidently occupied him h thoseadvisers said he f we had listened to them all we should not havemade peace with urkey and should not have been through with that warverything in haste but more haste less speed amenski would havebeen lost if he had not died e stormed fortresses with thirty thousandmen t is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult towin a campaign or that not storming and attacking but patience andtime are wanted amenski sent soldiers to ustchuk but  only employedthese two things and took more fortresses than amenski and made themurks eat horseflesh e swayed his head nd the rench shall toobelieve me he went on growing warmer and beating his chest llmake them eat horseflesh nd tears again dimmed his eyes verything comes in time to him who knows how to waitut shant we have to accept battle remarked rince ndrewe shall if everybody wants it it cant be helped ut believe memy dear boy there is nothing stronger than those two patience andtime they will do it all ut the advisers nentendent pas de cetteoreille voila le mal  ome want a thingothers dont hats one todo he asked evidently expecting an answer ell what do you want usto do he repeated and his eye shone with a deep shrewd look lltell you what to do he continued as rince ndrew still did notreply  will tell you what to do and what  do ans le doute moncher he paused abstienstoi he articulated the rench proverbdeliberately ont see it that way thats the trouble  hen in doubt my dear fellow do nothingell goodby my dear fellow remember that with all my heart  shareyour sorrow and that for you  am not a erene ighness nor a princenor a commanderinchief but a father f you want anything comestraight to me oodbye my dear boygain he embraced and kissed rince ndrew but before the latter hadleft the room utuzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with hisunfinished novel es hevaliers du ygne by adame de enlisrince ndrew could not have explained how or why it was but after thatinterview with utuzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to thegeneral course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had beenentrusted he more he realized the absence of all personal motive inthat old manin whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passionsand in place of an intellect grouping events and drawing conclusionsonly the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of eventsthe morereassured he was that everything would be as it should e will notbring in any plan of his own e will not devise or undertake anythingthought rince ndrew but he will hear everything remembereverything and put everything in its place e will not hinder anythinguseful nor allow anything harmful e understands that there issomething stronger and more important than his own willthe inevitablecourse of events and he can see them and grasp their significance andseeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce hispersonal wish directed to something else nd above all thought rincendrew one believes in him because hes ussian despite the novel byenlis and the rench proverbs and because his voice shook when hesaid hat they have brought us to and had a sob in it when he saidhe would make them eat horsefleshn such feelings more or less dimly shared by all the unanimity andgeneral approval were founded with which despite court influences thepopular choice of utuzov as commanderinchief was received fter the mperor had left oscow life flowed on there in its usualcourse and its course was so very usual that it was difficult toremember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor hard to believethat ussia was really in danger and that the members of the nglishlub were also sons of the atherland ready to sacrifice everything forit he one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone haddisplayed during the mperors stay was the call for contributions ofmen and money a necessity that as soon as the promises had been madeassumed a legal official form and became unavoidableith the enemys approach to oscow the oscovites view of theirsituation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even morefrivolous as always happens with people who see a great dangerapproaching t the approach of danger there are always two voices thatspeak with equal power in the human soul one very reasonably tells aman to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping itthe other still more reasonably says that it is too depressing andpainful to think of the danger since it is not in mans power toforesee everything and avert the general course of events and it istherefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes and tothink about what is pleasant n solitude a man generally listens to thefirst voice but in society to the second o it was now with theinhabitants of oscow t was long since people had been as gay inoscow as that yearostopchins broadsheets headed by woodcuts of a drink shop a potmanand a oscow burgher called arpushka higirin

foreignersfrom oscow and that there had been some spies and agents of apoleonamong them but this was told chiefly to introduce ostopchins wittyremark on that occasion he foreigners were deported to

the tortured renchman and the crowd surrounding theobnoe lace ierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could nolonger remain in oscow and would leave for the army that very day thatit seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that theman ought to have known it for himselfn reaching home ierre gave orders to vstafeyhis head coachman whoknew everything could do anything and was known to all oscowthat hewould leave that night for the army at ozhaysk and that his saddlehorses should be sent there his could not all be arranged that day soon vstafeys representation ierre had to put off his departure tillnext day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advancen the twentyfourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain andafter dinner ierre left oscow hen changing horses that night inerkhushkovo he learned that there had been a great battle thatevening his was the battle of hevardino e was told that there inerkhushkovo the earth trembled from the firing but nobody could answerhis questions as to who had won t dawn next day ierre was approachingozhayskvery house in ozhaysk had soldiers quartered in it and at the hostelwhere ierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to behad t was full of officersverywhere in ozhaysk and beyond it troops were stationed or on themarch ossacks foot and horse soldiers wagons caissons and cannonwere everywhere ierre pushed forward as fast as he could and thefarther he left oscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea oftroops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new andjoyful feeling he had not experienced before t was a feeling akin towhat he had felt at the loboda alace during the mperors visitasense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificingsomething e now experienced a glad consciousness that everything thatconstitutes mens happinessthe comforts of life wealth even lifeitselfis rubbish it is pleasant to throw away compared withsomething ith what ierre could not say and he did not try todetermine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight insacrificing everything e was not occupied with the question of what tosacrifice for the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new andjoyous sensation n the twentyfourth of ugust the battle of the hevardino edoubt wasfought on the twentyfifth not a shot was fired by either side and onthe twentysixth the battle of orodino itself took placehy and how were the battles of hevardino and orodino given andaccepted hy was the battle of orodino fought here was not the leastsense in it for either the rench or the ussians ts immediate resultfor the ussians was and was bound to be that we were brought nearerto the destruction of oscowwhich we feared more than anything in theworld and for the rench its immediate result was that they werebrought nearer to the destruction of their whole armywhich they fearedmore than anything in the world hat the result must be was quiteobvious and yet apoleon offered and utuzov accepted that battlef the commanders had been guided by reason it would seem that it musthave been obvious to apoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred milesand giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army hewas advancing to certain destruction and it must have been equallyclear to utuzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of aquarter of his army he would certainly lose oscow or utuzov this wasmathematically clear as it is that if when playing draughts  have oneman less and go on exchanging  shall certainly lose and thereforeshould not exchange hen my opponent has sixteen men and  havefourteen  am only one eighth weaker than he but when  have exchangedthirteen more men he will be three times as strong as  amefore the battle of orodino our strength in proportion to the renchwas about as five to six but after that battle it was little more thanone to two previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred andtwenty thousand afterwards little more than fifty thousand against ahundred thousand et the shrewd and experienced utuzov accepted thebattle while apoleon who was said to be a commander of genius gaveit losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines ofcommunication still more f it is said that he expected to end thecampaign by occupying oscow as he had ended a previous campaign byoccupying ienna there is much evidence to the contrary apoleonshistorians themselves tell us that from molensk onwards he wished tostop knew the danger of his extended position and knew that theoccupation of oscow would not be the end of the campaign for he hadseen at molensk the state in which ussian towns were left to him andhad not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of hiswish to negotiaten giving and accepting battle at orodino utuzov acted involuntarilyand irrationally ut later on to fit what had occurred the historiansprovided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of thegenerals who of all the blind tools of history were the most enslavedand involuntaryhe ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnishthe whole interest of the story and we are still unable to accustomourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind aremeaninglessn the other question how the battle of orodino and the precedingbattle of hevardino were fought there also exists a definite and wellknown but quite false conception ll the historians describe theaffair as followshe ussian army they say in its retreat from molensk sought out foritself the best position for a general engagement and found such aposition at orodinohe ussians they say fortified this position in advance on the leftof the highroad from oscow to molensk and almost at a right angle toit from orodino to titsa at the very place where the battle wasfoughtn front of this position they say a fortified outpost was set up onthe hevardino mound to observe the enemy n the twentyfourth we aretold apoleon attacked this advanced post and took it and on thetwentysixth attacked the whole ussian army which was in position onthe field of orodinoo the histories say and it is all quite wrong as anyone who cares tolook into the matter can easily convince himselfhe ussians did not seek out the best position but on the contraryduring the retreat passed many positions better than orodino hey didnot stop at any one of these positions because utuzov did not wish tooccupy a position he had not himself chosen because the popular demandfor a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough and becauseiloradovich had not yet arrived with the militia and for many otherreasons he fact is that other positions they had passed were strongerand that the position at orodino the one where the battle was foughtfar from being strong was no more a position than any other spot onemight find in the ussian mpire by sticking a pin into the map athazardot only did the ussians not fortify the position on the field oforodino to the left of and at a right angle to the highroad that isthe position on which the battle took place but never till the twentyfifth of ugust  did they think that a battle might be foughtthere his was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchmentsthere by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the twentyfifth andtwentysixth were not completed and secondly by the position of thehevardino edoubt hat redoubt was quite senseless in front of theposition where the battle was accepted hy was it more stronglyfortified than any other post nd why were all efforts exhausted andsix thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on thetwentyfourth  ossack patrol would have sufficed to observe theenemy hirdly as proof that the position on which the battle wasfought had not been foreseen and that the hevardino edoubt was not anadvanced post of that position we have the fact that up to the twentyfifth arclay de olly and agration were convinced that the hevardinoedoubt was the left flank of the position and that utuzov himself inhis report written in hot haste after the battle speaks of thehevardino edoubt as the left flank of the position t was much laterwhen reports on the battle of orodino were written at leisure that theincorrect and extraordinary statement was invented probably to justifythe mistakes of a commanderinchief who had to be represented asinfallible that the hevardino edoubt was an advanced postwhereas inreality it was simply a fortified point on the left flankand that thebattle of orodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previouslyselected where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which wasalmost unentrenchedhe case was evidently this a position was selected along the riverolochawhich crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acuteangleso that the left flank was at hevardino the right flank nearthe village of ovoe and the center at orodino at the confluence ofthe rivers olocha and oynao anyone who looks at the field of orodino without thinking of how thebattle was actually fought this position protected by the riverolocha presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was toprevent an enemy from advancing along the molensk road to oscowapoleon riding to aluevo on the twentyfourth did not see as thehistory books say he did the position of the ussians from titsa toorodino he could not have seen that position because it did notexist nor did he see an advanced post of the ussian army but whilepursuing the ussian rearguard he came upon the left flank of theussian positionat the hevardino edoubtand unexpectedly for theussians moved his army across the olocha nd the ussians not havingtime to begin a general engagement withdrew their left wing from theposition they had intended to occupy and took up a new position whichhad not been foreseen and was not fortified y crossing to the otherside of the olocha to the left of the highroad apoleon shifted thewhole forthcoming battle from right to left looking from the ussianside and transferred it to the plain between titsa emenovsk andorodinoa plain no more advantageous as a position than any otherplain in ussiaand there the whole battle of the twentysixth ofugust took placead apoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twentyfourth to theolocha and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubtbut had begun the attack next morning no one would have doubted thatthe hevardino edoubt was the left flank of our position and thebattle would have taken place where we expected it n that case weshould probably have defended the hevardino edoubtour left flankstill more obstinately e should have attacked apoleon in the centeror on the right and the engagement would have taken place on thetwentyfifth in the position we intended and had fortified ut as theattack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat ofour rear guard that is immediately after the fight at ridneva andas the ussian commanders did not wish or were not in time to begin ageneral engagement then on the evening of the twentyfourth the firstand chief action of the battle of orodino was already lost on thetwentyfourth and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on thetwentysixthfter the loss of the hevardino edoubt we found ourselves on themorning of the twentyfifth without a position for our left flank andwere forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced tobeot only was the ussian army on the twentysixth defended by weakunfinished entrenchments but the disadvantage of that position wasincreased by the fact that the ussian commandersnot having fullyrealized what had happened namely the loss of our position on the leftflank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle fromright to leftmaintained their extended position from the village ofovoe to titsa and consequently had to move their forces from right toleft during the battle o it happened that throughout the whole battlethe ussians opposed the entire rench army launched against our leftflank with but half as many men oniatowskis action against titsaand varovs on the right flank against the rench were actionsdistinct from the main course of the battle o the battle of orodinodid not take place at all as in an effort to conceal our commandersmistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the ussianarmy and people it has been described he battle of orodino was notfought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightlyweaker than those of the enemy but as a result of the loss of thehevardino edoubt the ussians fought the battle of orodino on anopen and almost unentrenched position with forces only half as numerousas the rench that is to say under conditions in which it was notmerely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisiveresult but unthinkable to keep an army even from completedisintegration and flight n the morning of the twentyfifth ierre was leaving ozhaysk t thedescent of the high steep hill down which a

understood whathe wanted to say and nodded approvalhe road was clear again ierre descended the hill and drove one kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces but onlysaw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of differentbranches of the service who all looked with astonishment at his whitehat and green tail coataving gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance andeagerly addressed him his was one of the head army doctors e wasdriving toward ierre in a covered gig sitting beside a young surgeonand on recognizing ierre he told the ossack who occupied the driversseat to pull upount our excellency how come you to be here asked the doctorell you know  wanted to seees yes there will be something to seeierre got out and talked to the doctor explaining his intention oftaking part in a battlehe doctor advised him to apply direct to utuzovhy should you be od knows where out of sight during the battle hesaid exchanging glances with his young

said ierrehe position repeated the doctor ell thats not my line rivepast atarinova a lot of digging is going on there o up the hillockand youll seean one see from there f you wouldut the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig would go with you but on my honor m up to hereand he pointed tohis throat m galloping to the commander of the corps ow do mattersstand ou know ount therell be a battle tomorrow ut of an armyof a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand woundedand we havent stretchers or bunks or dressers or doctors enough forsix thousand e have ten thousand

hadnoticed twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and deathamazed ierrehey may die tomorrow why are they thinking of anything but deathnd by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the ozhaysk hillthe carts with the wounded the ringing bells the slanting rays of thesun and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mindhe cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a momentthink of what awaits them but pass by winking at the wounded et fromamong these men twenty thousand are doomed to die and they wonder at myhat trange thought ierre continuing his

peasant militiamen in their white shirts and withcrosses on their caps who talking and laughing loudly animated andperspiring were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to theright of the

who were evidently still amused by the novelty of theirposition as soldiers ierre once more thought of the wounded men atozhaysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said heywant the whole nation to fall on them he sight of these beardedpeasants at work on the battlefield with their queer clumsy boots andperspiring necks and their shirts opening from the left toward themiddle unfastened exposing their sunburned collarbones impressedierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the momentthan anything he had yet seen or heard ierre stepped out of his carriage and passing the toiling militiamenascended the knoll from which according to the doctor the battlefieldcould be seent was about eleven oclock he sun shone somewhat to the left andbehind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which rising likean amphitheater extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphererom above on the left bisecting that amphitheater wound the molenskhighroad passing through a village with a white church some fivehundred paces in front of the knoll and below it his was orodinoelow the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and windingdown and up rose

said the officer turning to his companionorodino the other corrected himhe officer evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk moved up toierrere those our men there ierre inquiredes and there further

missing tomorrow but ought not to speakof itell send number three company again the officer replied hurriedlynd you are you one of the doctorso ve come on my own answered ierre and he went down the hillagain passing the militiamenh those damned fellows muttered the officer who followed himholding his nose as he ran past the men at workhere they are bringing her coming here they are heyll behere in a minute voices were suddenly heard saying and officerssoldiers and militiamen began running forward along the road church procession was coming up the hill from orodino irst alongthe dusty road

down their spades and ran to meet thechurch procession ollowing the battalion that marched along the dustyroad came priests in their vestmentsone little old man in a hood withattendants and singers ehind them soldiers and officers bore a largedarkfaced icon with an embossed metal cover his was the icon that hadbeen brought from molensk and had since accompanied the army ehindbefore and on both sides crowds of militiamen with bared heads walkedran and bowed to the groundt the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon the men who hadbeen holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved byothers the chanters relit their censers and service began he hotrays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played withthe hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the iconhe singing did not sound loud under the open sky n immense crowd ofbareheaded officers soldiers and militiamen surrounded the iconehind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spotreserved for them  bald general with a t eorges ross on his neckstood just behind the priests back and without crossing himself hewas evidently a erman patiently awaited the end of the service whichhe considered it necessary to hear to the end probably to arouse thepatriotism of the ussian people nother general stood in a martialpose crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest whilelooking about him tanding among the crowd of peasants ierrerecognized several acquaintances among these notables but did not lookat themhis whole attention was absorbed in watching the seriousexpression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who wereall gazing eagerly at the icon s soon as the tired chanters who weresinging the service for the twentieth time that day began lazily andmechanically to sing ave from calamity hy servants  other ofod and the priest and deacon chimed in or to hee under od we allflee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection there again kindled inall those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity ofthe impending moment that ierre had seen on the faces at the foot ofthe hill at ozhaysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had metthat morning and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed backand sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heardhe crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against ierreomeone a very important personage judging by the haste with which waywas made for him was approaching the icont was utuzov who had been riding round the position and on his wayback to atarinova had stopped where the service was being held ierrerecognized him at once by his peculiar figure which distinguished himfrom everybody elseith a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout roundshouldered bodywith uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of theeye he had lost utuzov walked with plunging swaying gait into thecrowd and stopped behind the priest e crossed himself with anaccustomed movement bent till he touched the ground with his hand andbowed his white head with a deep sigh ehind utuzov was ennigsen andthe suite espite the presence of the commanderinchief who attractedthe attention of all the superior officers the militiamen and soldierscontinued their prayers without looking at himhen the service was over utuzov stepped up to the icon sank heavilyto his knees bowed to the ground and for a long time tried vainly torise but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight iswhite head twitched with the effort t last he rose kissed the icon asa child does with naively pouting lips and again bowed till he touchedthe ground with his hand he other generals followed his example thenthe officers and after them with excited faces pressing on oneanother crowding panting and pushing scrambled the soldiers andmilitiamen taggering amid the crush ierre looked about himount eter irilovich ow did you get here said a voiceierre looked round oris rubetskoy brushing his knees with his handhe had probably soiled them when he too had knelt before the iconcame up to him smiling oris was elegantly dressed with a slightlymartial touch appropriate to a campaign e wore a long coat and likeutuzov had a whip slung across his shouldereanwhile utuzov had reached the village and seated himself in theshade of the nearest house on a bench which one ossack had run tofetch and another had hastily covered with a rug n immense andbrilliant suite surrounded himhe icon was carried further accompanied by the

others whom ierre knew came up to him and he had nottime to reply to all the questions about oscow that were showered uponhim or to listen to all that was told him he faces all expressedanimation and apprehension but it seemed to ierre that the cause ofthe excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions ofpersonal success his mind however was occupied by the differentexpression he saw on other facesan expression that spoke not ofpersonal matters but of the universal questions of life and deathutuzov noticed ierres figure and the group gathered round himall him to me said utuzovn adjutant told ierre of his erene ighness wish and ierre wenttoward utuzovs bench ut a militiaman got there before him t wasolokhovow did that fellow get here asked ierrees a creature that wriggles in anywhere was the answer e hasbeen degraded you know ow he wants to bob up again es beenproposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemys picketline at night es a brave fellowierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to utuzov concluded that if  reported to your erene ighness you might sendme away or say that you knew what  was reporting but then  shouldntlose anything olokhov was sayinges yesut if  were right  should be rendering a service to my atherlandfor which  am ready to diees yesnd should your erene ighness require a man who will not spare hisskin please think of me erhaps  may prove useful to your ereneighnesses es utuzov repeated his laughing eye narrowing more andmore as he looked at ierreust then oris with his courtierlike adroitness stepped up toierres side near utuzov and in a most natural manner without raisinghis voice said to ierre as though continuing an interruptedconversationhe militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die hatheroism ountoris evidently said this to ierre in order to be overheard by hiserene ighness e knew utuzovs attention would be caught by thosewords and so it washat are you saying about the militia he asked orisreparing for tomorrow your erene ighnessfor deaththey have puton clean shirtsh a wonderful a matchless people said utuzov and he closed hiseyes and swayed his head  matchless people he repeated with a sigho you want to smell gunpowder he said to ierre es its apleasant smell  have the honor to be one of your wifes adorers sshe well y quarters are at your servicend as often happens with old people utuzov began looking aboutabsentmindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or dohen evidently remembering what he wanted he beckoned to ndrewaysarov his adjutants brotherhose verses those verses of arins how do they go eh hose hewrote about erakov ectures for the corps inditing ecite themrecite them said he evidently preparing to laughaysarov recited utuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm ofthe verseshen ierre had left utuzov olokhov came up to him and took his hand am very glad to meet you here ount he said aloud regardless ofthe presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemntone n the eve of a day when od alone knows who of us is fated tosurvive  am glad of this opportunity to tell you that  regret themisunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not tohave any ill feeling for me  beg you to forgive meierre looked at olokhov with a smile not knowing what to say to himith tears in his eyes olokhov embraced ierre and kissed himoris said a few words to his general and ount ennigsen turned toierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the linet will interest you said hees very much replied ierrealf an hour later utuzov left for atarinova and ennigsen and hissuite with ierre among them set out on their ride along the line rom orki ennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which whenthey had looked at it from the hill the officer had pointed out asbeing the center of our position and where rows of fragrant newmown haylay by the riverside hey rode across that bridge into the village oforodino and thence turned to the left passing an enormous number oftroops and guns and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digginghis was the redoubt as yet unnamed which afterwards became known asthe aevski edoubt or the noll attery but ierre paid no specialattention to it e did not know that it would become more memorable tohim than any other spot on the plain of orodinohey then crossed the hollow to emenovsk where the soldiers weredragging away the last logs from the huts and barns hen they rodedownhill and uphill across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if byhail following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrowsof the plowed land and reached some fleches  which were still beingdug  kind of entrenchmentt the fleches ennigsen stopped and began looking at the hevardinoedoubt opposite which had been ours the day before and where severalhorsemen could be descried he officers said that either apoleon orurat was there and they all gazed eagerly at this little group ofhorsemen ierre also looked at them trying to guess which of thescarcely discernible figures was apoleon t last those mounted menrode away from the mound and disappearedennigsen spoke to a general who approached him and began explainingthe whole position of our troops ierre listened to him straining eachfaculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle butwas mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for thetask e could make nothing of it ennigsen stopped speaking andnoticing that ierre was listening suddenly said to him dont think this interests youn the contrary its very interesting replied ierre not quitetruthfullyrom the fleches they rode still farther to the left along a roadwinding through a thick lowgrowing birch wood n the middle of thewood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and scared by the tramp ofthe many horses grew so confused that it leaped along the road in frontof them for some time arousing general attention and laughter and onlywhen several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappearin the thicket fter going through the wood for about a mile and a halfthey came out on a glade where troops of uchkovs corps were stationedto defend the left flankere at the extreme left flank ennigsen talked a great deal and withmuch heat and as it seemed to ierre gave orders of great militaryimportance n front of uchkovs troops was some high ground notoccupied by troops ennigsen loudly criticized this mistake sayingthat it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country aroundunoccupied and to place troops below it ome of the generals expressedthe same opinion ne in particular declared with martial heat that theywere put there to be slaughtered ennigsen on his own authority orderedthe troops to occupy the high ground his disposition on the left flankincreased ierres doubt of his own capacity to understand militarymatters istening to ennigsen and the generals criticizing theposition of the troops behind the hill he quite understood them andshared their opinion but for that very reason he could not understandhow the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so grossand palpable a blunderierre did not know that these troops were not as ennigsen supposedput there to defend the position but were in a concealed position as anambush that they should not be seen and might be able to strike anapproaching enemy unexpectedly ennigsen did not know this and movedthe troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning thematter to the commanderinchief n that bright evening of ugust  rince ndrew lay leaning on hiselbow in a brokendown shed in the village of nyazkovo at the furtherend of his regiments encampment hrough a gap in the broken wall hecould see beside the wooden fence a row of thirty yearold bircheswith their lower branches lopped off a field on which shocks of oatswere standing and some bushes near which rose the smoke of campfiresthe soldiers kitchensarrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed tohim rince ndrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable ashe had done seven years before at usterlitze had received and given the orders for next days battle and hadnothing more to do ut his thoughtsthe simplest clearest andtherefore most terrible thoughtswould give him no peace e knew thattomorrows battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken partin and for the first time in his life the possibility of deathpresented itself to himnot in relation to any worldly matter or withreference to its effect on others but simply in relation to himself tohis own soulvividly plainly terribly and almost as a certainty ndfrom the height of this perception all that had previously tormented andpreoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light withoutshadows without perspective without distinction of outline ll lifeappeared to him like magiclantern pictures at which he had long beengazing by artificial light through a glass ow he suddenly saw thosebadly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass es yeshere they are those false images that agitated enraptured andtormented me said he to himself passing in review the principalpictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the coldwhite daylight of his clear perception of death here they are thoserudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious lorythe good of society love of a woman the atherland itselfhowimportant these pictures appeared to me with what profound meaning theyseemed to be filled nd it is all so simple pale and crude in thecold white light of this morning which  feel is dawning for me hethree great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular hislove for a woman his fathers death and the rench invasion which hadoverrun half ussia ove that little girl who seemed to me brimmingover with mystic forces es indeed  loved her  made romantic plansof love and happiness with her h what a boy  was he said aloudbitterly h me  believed in some ideal love which was to keep herfaithful to me for the whole year of my absence ike the gentle dove inthe fable she was to pine apart from me ut it was much simplerreally t was all very simple and horriblehen my father built ald ills he thought the place was his his landhis air his peasants ut apoleon came and swept him asideunconscious of his existence as he might brush a chip from his pathand his ald ills and his whole life fell to pieces rincess ary saysit is a trial sent from above hat is the trial for when he is nothere and will never return e is not here or whom then is the trialintended he atherland the destruction of oscow nd tomorrow shall be killed perhaps not even by a renchman but by one of our ownmen by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of themdid yesterday and the rench will come and take me by head and heelsand fling me into a hole that  may not stink under their noses and newconditions of life will arise which will seem quite ordinary to othersand about which  shall know nothing  shall not existe looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine with theirmotionless green and yellow foliage and white bark o die to bekilled tomorrow hat  should not exist hat all this should stillbe but no mend the birches with their light and shade the curly clouds the smokeof the campfires and all that was around him changed and seemedterrible and menacing  cold shiver ran down his spine e rosequickly went out of the shed and began to walk aboutfter he had returned voices were heard outside the shed hos thathe criedhe rednosed aptain imokhin formerly olokhovs squadron commanderbut now from lack of officers a battalion commander shyly entered theshed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymasterrince ndrew rose hastily listened to the business they had comeabout gave them some further instructions and was about to dismissthem when he heard a familiar lisping voice behind the shedevil take it said the voice of a man stumbling over somethingrince ndrew looked out of the shed and saw ierre who had trippedover a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen coming his way t wasunpleasant to rince ndrew to meet people of his own set in generaland ierre especially for he reminded him of all the painful moments ofhis last visit to oscowou hat a surprise said he hat brings you here his isunexpecteds he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldnesstheyexpressed hostility which ierre noticed at once e had approached theshed full of animation but on seeing rince ndrews face he feltconstrained and ill at ease have come simply you know come it interests me saidierre who had so often that day senselessly repeated that wordinteresting  wish to see the battleh yes and what do the masonic brothers say about war ow would theystop it said rince ndrew sarcastically ell and hows oscow ndmy people ave they reached oscow at last he asked seriouslyes they have ulie rubetskaya told me so  went to see them butmissed them hey have gone to your estate near oscow he officers were about to take leave but rince ndrew apparentlyreluctant to be left alone with his friend asked them to stay and havetea eats were brought in and so was the tea he officers gazed withsurprise at ierres huge stout figure and listened to his talk ofoscow and the position of our army round which he had ridden rincendrew remained silent and his expression was so forbidding that ierreaddressed his remarks chiefly to the goodnatured battalion commandero you understand the whole position of our troops rince ndrewinterrupted himesthat is how do you mean said ierre ot being a military man cant say  have understood it fully but  understand the generalpositionell then you know more than anyone else be it who it may saidrince ndrewh said ierre looking over his spectacles in perplexity at rincendrew ell and what do you think of utuzovs appointment heasked was very glad of his appointment thats all  know replied rincendrewnd tell me your opinion of arclay de olly n oscow they are sayingheaven knows what about him hat do you think of himsk them replied rince ndrew indicating the officersierre looked at imokhin with the condescendingly interrogative smilewith which everybody involuntarily addressed that officere see light again since his erenity has been appointed yourexcellency said imokhin timidly and continually turning to glance athis colonelhy so asked ierreell to mention only firewood and fodder let me inform you hy whenwe were retreating from ventsyani we dare not touch a stick or a wispof hay or anything ou see we were going away so he would get it allwasnt it so your excellency and again imokhin turned to the princeut we darent n our regiment two officers were courtmartialed forthat kind of thing ut when his erenity took command everything becamestraight forward ow we see lighthen why was it forbiddenimokhin looked about in confusion not knowing what or how to answersuch a question ierre put the same question to rince ndrewhy so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to theenemy said rince ndrew with venomous irony t is very sound onecant permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops tomarauding t molensk too he judged correctly that the rench mightoutflank us as they had larger forces ut he could not understandthis cried rince ndrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape himinvoluntarily he could not understand that there for the first timewe were fighting for ussian soil and that there was a spirit in themen such as  had never seen before that we had held the rench for twodays and that that success had increased our strength tenfold eordered us to retreat and all our efforts and losses went for nothinge had no thought of betraying us he tried to do the best he could hethought out everything and that is why he is unsuitable e isunsuitable now just because he plans out everything very thoroughly andaccurately as every erman has to ow can  explain ell say yourfather has a erman valet and he is a splendid valet and satisfies yourfathers requirements better than you could then its all right to lethim serve ut if your father is mortally sick youll send the valetaway and attend to your father with your own unpracticed awkward handsand will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger couldo it has been with arclay hile ussia was well a foreigner couldserve her and be a splendid minister but as soon as she is in dangershe needs one of her own kin ut in your club they have been making himout a traitor hey slander him as a traitor and the only result willbe that afterwards ashamed of their false accusations they will makehim out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor and that will be stillmore unjust e is an honest and very punctilious ermannd they say hes a skillful commander rejoined ierre dont understand what is meant by a skillful commander repliedrince ndrew ironically skillful commander replied ierre hy one who foresees allcontingencies and foresees the adversarys intentionsut thats impossible said rince ndrew as if it were a mattersettled long agoierre looked at him in surprisend yet they say that war is like a game of chess he remarkedes replied rince ndrew but with this little difference that inchess you may think over each move as long as you please and are notlimited for time and with this difference too that a knight is alwaysstronger than a pawn and two pawns are always stronger than one whilein war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimesweaker than a company he relative strength of bodies of troops cannever be known to anyone elieve me he went on if things dependedon arrangements made by the staff  should be there makingarrangements but instead of that  have the honor to serve here in theregiment with these gentlemen and  consider that on us tomorrowsbattle will depend and not on those others uccess never dependsand never will depend on position or equipment or even on numbersand least of all on positionut on what thenn the feeling that is in me and in him he pointed to imokhin andin each soldierrince ndrew glanced at imokhin who looked at his commander in alarmand bewilderment n contrast to his former reticent taciturnity rincendrew now seemed excited e could apparently not refrain fromexpressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it hy did we losethe battle at usterlitz he rench losses were almost equal to oursbut very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle andwe did lose it nd we said so because we had nothing to fight forthere we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we couldeve lost so let us run and we ran f we had not said that tillthe evening heaven knows what might not have happened ut tomorrow weshant say it ou talk about our position the left flank weak and theright flank too extended he went on hats all nonsense theresnothing of the kind ut what awaits us tomorrow  hundred million mostdiverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact thatour men or theirs run or do not run and that this man or that man iskilled but all that is being done at present is only play he fact isthat those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only donot help matters but hinder hey are only concerned with their ownpetty interestst such a moment said ierre reproachfullyt such a moment rince ndrew repeated o them it is only a momentaffording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra crossor ribbon or me tomorrow means this a ussian army of a hundredthousand and a rench army of a hundred thousand have met to fight andthe thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the sidethat fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win nd if youlike  will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those atthe top may make we shall win tomorrows battle omorrow happen whatmay we shall winhere now your excellency hats the truth the real truth saidimokhin ho would spare himself now he soldiers in my battalionbelieve me wouldnt drink their vodka ts not the day for thatthey sayll were silent he officers rose rince ndrew went out of the shedwith them giving final orders to the adjutant fter they had goneierre approached rince ndrew and was about to start a conversationwhen they heard the clatter of three horses hoofs on the road not farfrom the shed and looking in that direction rince ndrew recognizedolzogen and lausewitz accompanied by a ossack hey rode close bycontinuing to converse and rince ndrew involuntarily heard thesewordser rieg muss in aum verlegt werden er nsicht kann ich nicht genugreis geben  said one of them he war must be extended widely  cannot sufficiently commend thatviewh ja said the other der weck ist nur den eind zu schwchen sokann man gewiss nicht den erlust der rivatersonen in chtungnehmen  h yes the only aim is to weaken the enemy so of course one cannottake into account the loss of private individualsh no agreed the otherxtend widely said rince ndrew with an angry snort when they hadridden past n that extend were my father son and sister at aldills hats all the same to him hats what  was saying to youthose erman gentlemen wont win the battle tomorrow but will only makeall the mess they can because they have nothing in their erman headsbut theories not worth an empty eggshell and havent in their hearts theone thing needed tomorrowthat which imokhin has hey have yielded upall urope to him and have now come to teach us ine teachers andagain his voice grew shrillo you think we shall win tomorrows battle asked ierrees yes answered rince ndrew absently ne thing  would do if had the power he began again  would not take prisoners hy takeprisoners ts chivalry he rench have destroyed my home and are ontheir way to destroy oscow they have outraged and are outraging meevery moment hey are my enemies n my opinion they are all criminalsnd so thinks imokhin and the whole army hey should be executedince they are my foes they cannot be my friends whatever may have beensaid at ilsites yes muttered ierre looking with shining eyes at rince ndrew quite agree with youhe question that had perturbed ierre on the ozhaysk hill and all thatday now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved e nowunderstood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of theimpending battle ll he had seen that day all the significant andstern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing were lit up forhim by a new light e understood that latent heat as they say inphysics of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seenand this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly and asit were lightheartedlyot take prisoners rince ndrew continued hat by itself wouldquite change the whole war and make it less cruel s it is we haveplayed at warthats whats vile e play at magnanimity and all thatstuff uch magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity andsensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed sheis so kindhearted that she cant look at blood but enjoys eating thecalf served up with sauce hey talk to us of the rules of war ofchivalry of flags of truce of mercy to the unfortunate and so on tsall rubbish  saw chivalry and flags of truce in  they humbuggedus and we humbugged them hey plunder other peoples houses issuefalse paper money and worst of all they kill my children and my fatherand then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes ake noprisoners but kill and be killed e who has come to this as  havethrough the same sufferingsrince ndrew who had thought it was all the same to him whether or notoscow was taken as molensk had been was suddenly checked in hisspeech by an unexpected cramp in his throat e paced up and down a fewtimes in silence but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lipsquivered as he began speakingf there was none of this magnanimity in war we should go to war onlywhen it was worth while going to certain death as now hen there wouldnot be war because aul vanovich had offended ichael vanovich ndwhen there was a war like this one it would be war nd then thedetermination of the troops would be quite different hen all theseestphalians and essians whom apoleon is leading would not follow himinto ussia and we should not go to fight in ustria and russiawithout knowing why ar is not courtesy but the most horrible thing inlife and we ought to understand that and not play at war e ought toaccept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously t all lies inthat get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game s it isnow war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous he militarycalling is the most highly honoredut what is war hat is needed for success in warfare hat are thehabits of the military he aim of war is murder the methods of war arespying treachery and their encouragement the ruin of a countrysinhabitants robbing them or stealing to provision the army and fraudand falsehood termed military craft he habits of the military classare the absence of freedom that is discipline idleness ignorancecruelty debauchery and drunkenness nd in spite of all this it is thehighest class respected by everyone ll the kings except the hinesewear military uniforms and he who kills most people receives thehighest rewardshey meet as we shall meet tomorrow to murder one another they killand maim tens of thousands and then have thanksgiving services forhaving killed so many people they even exaggerate the number and theyannounce a victory supposing that the more people they have killed thegreater their achievement ow does od above look at them and hearthem exclaimed rince ndrew in a shrill piercing voice h myfriend it has of late become hard for me to live  see that  havebegun to understand too much nd it doesnt do for man to taste of thetree of knowledge of good and evil h well its not for long headdedowever youre sleepy and its time for me to sleep o back toorki said rince ndrew suddenlyh no ierre replied looking at rince ndrew with frightenedcompassionate eyeso go efore a battle one must have ones sleep out repeated rincendrewe came quickly up to ierre and embraced and kissed him oodbye beoff he shouted hether we meet again or not and turning awayhurriedly he entered the shedt was already dark and ierre could not make out whether theexpression of rince ndrews face was angry or tenderor some time he stood in silence considering whether he should followhim or go away o he does not want it ierre concluded nd  knowthat this is our last meeting e sighed deeply and rode back to orkin reentering the shed rince ndrew lay down on a rug but he couldnot sleepe closed his eyes ne picture succeeded another in his imagination none of them he dwelt long and joyfully e vividly recalled an eveningin etersburg atasha with animated and excited face was telling himhow she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had losther way in the big forest he incoherently described the depths of theforest her feelings and a talk with a beekeeper she met andconstantly interrupted her story to say o  cant m not tellingit right no you dont understand though he encouraged her by sayingthat he did understand and he really had understood all she wanted tosay ut atasha was not satisfied with her own words she felt thatthey did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experiencedthat day and wished to convey e was such a delightful old man and itwas so dark in the forest and he had such kind o  cantdescribe it she had said flushed and excited rince ndrew smilednow the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes understood her he thought  not only understood her but it was justthat inner spiritual force that sincerity that frankness of soulthat very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her bodyit wasthat soul  loved in her loved so strongly and happily andsuddenly he remembered how his love had ended e did not need anythingof that kind e neither saw nor understood anything of the sort eonly saw in her a pretty and fresh young girl with whom he did notdeign to unite his fate nd  and he is still alive and gayrince ndrew jumped up as if someone had burned him and again beganpacing up and down in front of the shed n ugust  the eve of the battle of orodino  de eausset prefectof the rench mperors palace arrived at apoleons quarters ataluevo with olonel abvier the former from aris and the latter fromadridonning his court uniform  de eausset ordered a box he had broughtfor the mperor to be carried before him and entered the firstcompartment of apoleons tent where he began opening the box whileconversing with apoleons aidesdecamp who surrounded himabvier not entering the tent remained at the entrance talking to somegenerals of his acquaintancehe mperor apoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing histoilet lightly snorting and grunting he presented now his back andnow his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbinghim down nother valet with his finger over the mouth of a bottle wassprinkling au de ologne on the mperors pampered body with anexpression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much aude ologne should be sprinkled apoleons short hair was wet and mattedon the forehead but his face though puffy and yellow expressedphysical satisfaction o on harder go on he muttered to the valetwho was rubbing him slightly twitching and grunting n aidedecampwho had entered the bedroom to report to the mperor the number ofprisoners taken in yesterdays action was standing by the door afterdelivering his message awaiting permission to withdraw apoleonfrowning looked at him from under his browso prisoners said he repeating the aidedecamps words hey areforcing us to exterminate them o much the worse for the ussianarmy o on harder harder he muttered hunching his back andpresenting his fat shouldersll right et onsieur de eausset enter and abvier too he saidnodding to the aidedecampes sire and the aidedecamp disappeared through the door of thetentwo valets rapidly dressed is ajesty and wearing the blue uniform ofthe uards he went with firm quick steps to the reception roome eaussets hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the presenthe had brought from the mpress on two chairs directly in front of theentrance ut apoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpectedrapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surpriseapoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they werenot ready e did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving hima surprise so he pretended not to see de eausset and called abvier tohim listening silently and with a stern frown to what abvier told himof the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at alamanca at theother end of urope with but one thoughtto be worthy of theirmperorand but one fearto fail to please him he result of thatbattle had been deplorable apoleon made ironic remarks duringabviers account as if he had not expected that matters could gootherwise in his absence must make up for that in oscow said apoleon ll see youlater he added and summoned de eausset who by that time hadprepared the surprise having placed something on the chairs and coveredit with a clothe eausset bowed low with that courtly rench bow which only the oldretainers of the ourbons knew how to make and approached himpresenting an envelopeapoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his earou have hurried here  am very glad ell what is aris saying heasked suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordialtoneire all aris regrets your absence replied de eausset as wasproperut though apoleon knew that de eausset had to say something of thiskind and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue he waspleased to hear it from him gain he honored him by touching his ear am very sorry to have made you travel so far said heire  expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of oscowreplied de eaussetapoleon smiled and lifting his head absentmindedly glanced to theright n aidedecamp approached with gliding steps and offered him agold snuffbox which he tookes it has happened luckily for you he said raising the opensnuffbox to his nose ou are fond of travel and in three days youwill see oscow ou surely did not expect to see that siatic capitalou will have a pleasant journeye eausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel ofwhich he had not till then been awarea whats this asked apoleon noticing that all the courtiers werelooking at something concealed under a clothith courtly adroitness de eausset half turned and without turning hisback to the mperor retired two steps twitching off the cloth at thesame time and said present to our ajesty from the mpresst was a portrait painted in bright colors by erard of the son borneto apoleon by the daughter of the mperor of ustria the boy whom forsome reason everyone called he ing of ome very pretty curlyheaded boy with a look of the hrist in the istineadonna was depicted playing at stick and ball he ball represented theterrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepterhough it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depictingthe socalled ing of ome spiking the earth with a stick the allegoryapparently seemed to apoleon as it had done to all who had seen it inaris quite clear and very pleasinghe ing of ome he said pointing to the portrait with a gracefulgesture dmirableith the natural capacity of an talian for changing the expression ofhis face at will he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look ofpensive tenderness e felt that what he now said and did would behistorical and it seemed to him that it would now be best for himwhose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with theterrestrial globeto show in contrast to that grandeur the simplestpaternal tenderness is eyes grew dim he moved forward glanced roundat a chair which seemed to place itself under him and sat down on itbefore the portrait t a single gesture from him everyone went out ontiptoe leaving the great man to himself and his emotionaving sat still for a while he touchedhimself not knowing whythethick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portraitrose and recalled de eausset and the officer on duty e ordered theportrait to be carried outside his tent that the ld uard stationedround it might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the ing ofome the son and heir of their adored monarchnd while he was doing  de eausset the honor of breakfasting withhim they heard as apoleon had anticipated the rapturous cries of theofficers and men of the ld uard who had run up to see the portraitive lmpereur ive le roi de ome ive lmpereur came thoseecstatic criesfter breakfast apoleon in de eaussets presence dictated his order ofthe day to the armyhort

his ride he went out of the tentto where the horses stood saddledour ajesty is too kind replied de eausset to the invitation toaccompany the mperor he wanted to sleep did not know how to ride andwas afraid of doing sout apoleon nodded to the traveler and de eausset had to mount henapoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the uards before hissons portrait grew still louder apoleon frownedake him away he said pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture tothe portrait t is too soon for him to see a field of battlee eausset closed his eyes bowed his head and sighed deeply toindicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the mperors words n the twentyfifth of ugust so his historians tell us apoleon spentthe whole day on horseback inspecting the locality considering planssubmitted to him by his marshals and personally giving commands to hisgeneralshe original line of the ussian forces along the river olocha had beendislocated by the capture of the hevardino edoubt on the twentyfourth and part of the linethe left flankhad been drawn back hatpart of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground wasmore open and level than elsewhere t was evident to anyone militaryor not that it was here the rench should attack t would seem thatnot much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion nor anyparticular care or trouble on the part of the mperor and his marshalsnor was there any need of that special and supreme quality called geniusthat people are so apt to ascribe to apoleon yet the historians whodescribed the event later and the men who then surrounded apoleon andhe himself thought otherwiseapoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profoundair and in silence nodded with approval or shook his head dubiouslyand without communicating to the generals around him the profound courseof ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his finalconclusions in the form of commands aving listened to a suggestionfrom avout who was now called rince dckmuhl to turn the ussianleft wing apoleon said it should not be done without explaining whynot o a proposal made by eneral ampan who was to attack thefleches to lead his division through the woods apoleon agreed thoughthe socalled uke of lchingen ey ventured to remark that a movementthrough the woods was dangerous and might disorder the divisionaving inspected the country opposite the hevardino edoubt apoleonpondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where twobatteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the ussianentrenchments and the places where in line with them the fieldartillery should be placedfter giving these and other commands he returned to his tent and thedispositions for the battle were written down from his dictationhese dispositions of which the rench historians write with enthusiasmand other historians with profound respect were as followst dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plainoccupied by the rince dckmuhl will open fire on the opposingbatteries of the enemyt the same time the commander of the artillery of the st orpseneral ernetti with thirty cannon of ampans division

will occupy the village and cross by its three bridgesadvancing to the same heights as orands and ibrards divisions whichunder his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come intoline with the rest of the forcesll this must be done in good order le tout se fera avec ordre etmethode as far as possible retaining troops in reservehe mperial amp near ozhayskeptember  hese dispositions which are very obscure and confused if one allowsoneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his geniusrelated to apoleons orders to deal with four pointsfour differentorders ot one of these was or could be carried outn the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on thespot chosen by apoleon with the guns of ernetti and ouche whichwere to come in line with them  guns in all were to open fire andshower shells on the ussian fleches and redoubts his could not bedone as from the spots selected by apoleon the projectiles did notcarry to the ussian works and those  guns shot into the air untilthe nearest commander contrary to apoleons instructions moved themforwardhe second order was that oniatowski moving to the village through thewood should turn the ussian left flank his could not be done and wasnot done because oniatowski advancing on the village through thewood met uchkov there barring his way and could not and did not turnthe ussian positionhe third order was eneral ampan will move through the wood to seizethe first fortification eneral ampans division did not seize thefirst fortification but was driven back for on emerging from the woodit had to reform under grapeshot of which apoleon was unawarehe fourth order was he viceing will occupy the village orodinoand cross by its three bridges advancing to the same heights asorands and drards divisions for whose movements no directions aregiven which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubtand come into line with the rest of the forcess far as one can make out not so much from this unintelligiblesentence as from the attempts the viceing made to execute the ordersgiven him he was to advance from the left through orodino to theredoubt while the divisions of orand and erard were to advancesimultaneously from the frontll this like the other parts of the disposition was not and could notbe executed fter passing through orodino the viceing was drivenback to the olocha and could get no farther while the divisions oforand and erard did not take the redoubt but were driven back and theredoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry a thingprobably unforeseen and not heard of by apoleon o not one of theorders in the disposition was or could be executed ut in thedisposition it is said that after the fight has commenced in thismanner orders will be given in accordance with the enemys movementsand so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would bemade by apoleon during the battle ut this was not and could not bedone for during the whole battle apoleon was so far away that asappeared later he could not know the course of the battle and not oneof his orders during the fight could be executed any historians say that the rench did not win the battle of orodinobecause apoleon had a cold and that if he had not had a cold theorders he gave before and during the battle would have been still morefull of genius and ussia would have been lost and the face of the worldhave been changed o historians who believe that ussia was shaped bythe will of one maneter the reatand that rance from a republicbecame an empire and rench armies went to ussia at the will of onemanapoleonto say that ussia remained a power because apoleon hada bad cold on the twentyfourth of ugust may seem logical andconvincingf it had depended on apoleons will to fight or not to fight thebattle of orodino and if this or that other arrangement depended onhis will then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his willmight have saved ussia and consequently the valet who omitted to bringapoleon his waterproof boots on the twentyfourth would have been thesavior of ussia long that line of thought such a deduction isindubitable as indubitable as the deduction oltaire made in jestwithout knowing what he was jesting at when he saw that the assacreof t artholomew was due to harles s stomach being deranged utto men who do not admit that ussia was formed by the will of one maneter  or that the rench mpire was formed and the war with ussiabegun by the will of one man apoleon that argument seems not merelyuntrue and irrational but contrary to all human reality o thequestion of what causes historic events another answer presents itselfnamely that the course of human events is predetermined from on highdepends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in theevents and that a apoleons influence on the course of these events ispurely external and fictitioustrange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the assacre oft artholomew was not due to harles s will though he gave theorder for it and thought it was done as a result of that order andstrange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousandmen at orodino was not due to apoleons will though he ordered thecommencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done becausehe ordered it strange as these suppositions appear yet human dignitywhich tells me that each of us is if not more at least not less a manthan the great apoleondemands the acceptance of that solution of thequestion and historic investigation abundantly confirms itt the battle of orodino apoleon shot at no one and killed no onehat was all done by the soldiers herefore it was not he who killedpeoplehe rench soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of orodinonot because of apoleons orders but by their own volition he wholearmyrench talian erman olish and utchhungry ragged andweary of the campaign felt at the sight of an army blocking their roadto oscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk ad apoleon thenforbidden them to fight the ussians they would have killed him andhave proceeded to fight the ussians because it was inevitablehen they heard apoleons proclamation offering them as compensationfor mutilation and death the words of posterity about their having beenin the battle before oscow they cried ive lmpereur just as theyhad cried ive lmpereur at the sight of the portrait of the boypiercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick and just as they wouldhave cried ive lmpereur at any nonsense that might be told themhere was nothing left for them to do but cry ive lmpereur and goto fight in order to get food and rest as conquerors in oscow o itwas not because of apoleons commands that they killed their fellowmennd it was not apoleon who directed the course of the battle for noneof his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know whatwas going on before him o the way in which these people killed oneanother was not decided by apoleons will but occurred independently ofhim in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who tookpart in the common action t only seemed to apoleon that it all tookplace by his will nd so the question whether he had or had not a coldhas no more historic interest than the cold of the least of thetransport soldiersoreover the assertion made by various writers that his cold was thecause of his dispositions not being as wellplanned as on formeroccasions and of his orders during the battle not being as good aspreviously is quite baseless which again shows that apoleons cold onthe twentysixth of ugust was unimportanthe dispositions cited above are not at all worse but are even betterthan previous dispositions by which he had won victories is pseudoorders during the battle were also no worse than formerly but much thesame as usual hese dispositions and orders only seem worse thanprevious ones because the battle of orodino was the first apoleon didnot win he profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seemvery bad and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks ofimportance when they relate to a battle that has been lost and thevery worst dispositions and orders seem very good and serious peoplefill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits when they relate to abattle that has been wonhe dispositions drawn up by eyrother for the battle of usterlitz werea model of perfection for that kind of composition but still they werecriticizedcriticized for their very perfection for their excessiveminutenessapoleon at the battle of orodino fulfilled his office asrepresentative of authority as well as and even better than at otherbattles e did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle heinclined to the most reasonable opinions he made no confusion did notcontradict himself did not get frightened or run away from the field ofbattle but with his great tact and military experience carried out hisrole of appearing to command calmly and with dignity n returning from a second inspection of the lines apoleon remarkedhe chessmen are set up the game will begin tomorrowaving ordered punch and summoned de eausset he began to talk to himabout aris and about some changes he meant to make in the mpresshousehold surprising the prefect by his memory of minute detailsrelating to the courte showed an interest in trifles joked about de eaussets love oftravel and chatted carelessly as a famous selfconfident surgeon whoknows his job does when turning up his

no one else could but now  can jest andthe more  jest and the calmer  am the more tranquil and confident youought to be and the more amazed at my geniusaving finished his second glass of punch apoleon went to rest beforethe serious business which he considered awaited him next day e wasso much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep and inspite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of theevening he went into the large division of the tent at three oclock inthe morning loudly blowing his nose e asked whether the ussians hadnot withdrawn and was told that the enemys fires were still in thesame places e nodded approvalhe adjutant in attendance came into the tentell app do you think we shall do good business today apoleonasked himithout doubt sire replied appapoleon

e was looking through a field glass down the highroad beforehimounting the steps to the knoll ierre looked at the scene before himspellbound by beauty t was the same panorama he had admired from thatspot the day before but now the whole place was full of troops andcovered by smoke clouds from the guns and the slanting rays of thebright sun rising slightly to the left behind ierre cast upon itthrough the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy goldentintedlight and long dark shadows he forest at the farthest extremity of thepanorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowishgreencolor its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon andwas pierced beyond aluevo by the molensk highroad crowded with troopsearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copseshere were troops to be seen everywhere in front and to the right andleft ll this was vivid majestic and unexpected but what impressedierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself of orodinoand the hollows on both sides of the olochabove the olocha in orodino and on both sides of it especially tothe left where the oyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into theolocha a mist had spread which seemed to melt to dissolve and tobecome translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically coloredand outlined everything he smoke of the guns mingled with this mistand over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morningsun were reflected flashing back like lightning from the water fromthe dew and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by theriverbanks and in orodino  white church could be seen through themist and here and there the roofs of huts in orodino as well as densemasses of soldiers or green ammunition

those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still whilewoods fields and glittering bayonets ran past them rom the leftover fields and bushes those large balls of smoke were continuallyappearing followed by their solemn reports while nearer still in thehollows and woods there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that hadno time to become balls but had their little echoes in just the sameway rakhtatatakh came the frequent crackle of musketry but itwas irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannonierre wished to be there with that smoke those shining bayonets thatmovement and those sounds e turned to look at utuzov and his suiteto compare his impressions with those of others hey were all lookingat the field of battle as he was and as it seemed to him with thesame feelings ll their faces were now shining with that latent warmthof feeling ierre had noticed the day before and had fully understoodafter his talk with rince ndrewo my dear fellow go and hrist be with you utuzov was sayingto a general who stood beside him not taking his eye from thebattlefieldaving received this order the general passed by ierre on his way downthe knollo the crossing said the general coldly and sternly in reply to oneof the staff who asked where he was goingll go there too  too thought ierre and followed the generalhe general mounted a horse a ossack had brought him ierre went tohis groom who was holding his horses and asking which was the quietestclambered onto it seized it by the mane and turning out his toespressed his heels against its sides and feeling that his spectacleswere slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins hegalloped after the general causing the staff officers to smile as theywatched him from the knoll aving descended the hill the general after whom ierre was gallopingturned sharply to the left and ierre losing sight of him galloped inamong some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him e tried to passeither in front of them or to the right or left but there were soldierseverywhere all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with someunseen but evidently important task hey all gazed with the samedissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hatwho for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horseshoofshy ride into the middle of the battalion one of them shouted at himnother prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket and ierrebending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horsegalloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free spacehere was a bridge ahead of him where other soldiers stood firingierre rode up to them ithout being aware of it he had come to thebridge across the olocha between orki and orodino which the renchhaving occupied orodino were attacking in the first phase of thebattle ierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and thatsoldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadowamong the rows of newmown hay which he had taken no notice of amid thesmoke of the campfires the day before but despite the incessant firinggoing on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle e didnot notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side or theprojectiles that flew over him did not see the enemy on the other sideof the river and for a long time did not notice the killed and woundedthough many fell near him e looked about him with a smile which didnot leave his facehys that fellow in front of the line shouted somebody at him againo the left eep to the right the men shouted to himierre went to the right and unexpectedly encountered one of aevskisadjutants whom he knew he adjutant looked angrily at him evidentlyalso intending to shout at him but on recognizing him he noddedow have you got here he said and galloped onierre feeling out of place there having nothing to do and afraid ofgetting in someones way again galloped after the adjutanthats happening here ay  come with you he askedne moment one moment replied the adjutant and riding up to a stoutcolonel who was standing in the meadow he gave him some message andthen addressed ierrehy have you come here ount he asked with a smile tillinquisitivees yes assented ierreut the adjutant turned his horse about and rode onere its tolerable said he but with agration on the left flanktheyre getting it frightfully hoteally said ierre here is thatome along with me to our knoll e can get a view from there and inour battery it is still bearable said the adjutant ill you comees ll come with you replied ierre looking round for his groomt was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or beingcarried on stretchers n that very meadow he had ridden over the daybefore a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay with hishead thrown awkwardly back and his shako offhy havent they carried him away ierre was about to ask but seeingthe stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way hechecked himselfierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with theadjutant to aevskis edoubt is horse lagged behind the adjutantsand jolted him at every stepou dont seem to be used to riding ount remarked the adjutanto its not that but her action seems so jerky said ierre in apuzzled tonehy shes wounded said the adjutant n the off foreleg above theknee  bullet no doubt  congratulate you ount on your baptism offireaving ridden in the smoke past the ixth orps behind the artillerywhich had been moved forward and was in action deafening them with thenoise of firing they came to a small wood here it was cool and quietwith a scent of autumn ierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked upthe hill on foots the general here asked the adjutant on reaching the knolle was here a minute ago but has just gone that way someone told himpointing to the righthe adjutant looked at ierre as if puzzled what to do with him nowont trouble about me said ierre ll go up onto the knoll if mayes do oull see everything from there and its less dangerous andll come for youierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on hey did not meetagain and only much later did ierre learn that he lost an arm thatdayhe knoll to which ierre ascended was that famous one afterwards knownto the ussians as the noll attery or aevskis edoubt and to therench as la grande redoute la fatale redoute la redoute du centrearound which tens of thousands fell and which the rench regarded asthe key to the whole positionhis redoubt consisted of a knoll on three sides of which trenches hadbeen dug ithin the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being firedthrough openings in the earthworkn line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also firedincessantly  little behind the guns stood infantry hen ascendingthat knoll ierre had no notion that this spot on which small trencheshad been dug and from which a few guns were firing was the mostimportant point of the battlen the contrary just because he happened to be there he thought it oneof the least significant parts of the fieldaving reached the knoll ierre sat down at one end of a trenchsurrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him withan unconsciously happy smile ccasionally he rose and walked about thebattery still with that same smile trying not to obstruct the soldierswho were loading hauling the guns and continually running past himwith bags and charges he guns of that battery were being firedcontinually one after another with a deafening roar enveloping thewhole neighborhood in powder smoken contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in supporthere in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work wereseparated from the rest by a trench everyone experienced a common andas it were family feeling of animationhe intrusion of ierres nonmilitary figure in a white hat made anunpleasant impression at first he soldiers looked askance at him withsurprise and even alarm as they went past him he senior artilleryofficer a tall longlegged pockmarked man moved over to ierre as ifto see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity young roundfaced officer quite a boy still and evidently only justout of the adet ollege who was zealously commanding the two gunsentrusted to him addressed ierre sternlyir he said permit me to ask you to stand aside ou must not beherehe soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at ierreut when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hatwas doing no harm but either sat quietly on the slope of the trenchwith a shy smile or politely making way for the soldiers paced up anddown the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevardtheir feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into akindly and bantering sympathy such as soldiers feel for their dogscocks goats and in general for the animals that live with theregiment he men soon accepted ierre into their family adopted himgave him a nickname our gentleman and made kindly fun of him amongthemselves shell tore up the earth two paces from ierre and he looked aroundwith a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown upnd hows it youre not afraid sir really now a redfaced broadshouldered soldier asked ierre with a grin that disclosed a set ofsound white teethre you afraid then said ierrehat else do you expect answered the soldier he has no mercy youknow hen she comes spluttering down out go your innards ne canthelp being afraid he said laughingeveral of the men with bright kindly faces stopped beside ierrehey seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else and thediscovery that he did so delighted themts the business of us soldiers ut in a gentleman its wonderfulheres a gentleman for youo your places cried the young officer to the men gathered roundierrehe young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first orsecond time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men withgreat precision and formalityhe booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing moreintense over the whole field especially to the left where agrationsfleches were but where ierre was the smoke of the firing made italmost impossible to distinguish anything oreover his whole attentionwas engrossed by watching the family circleseparated from all elseformed by the men in the battery is first unconscious feeling ofjoyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefieldwas now replaced by another especially since he had seen that soldierlying alone in the hayfield ow seated on the slope of the trench heobserved the faces of those around himy ten oclock some twenty men had already been carried away from thebattery two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and morefrequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled aroundut the men in the battery seemed not to notice this and merry voicesand jokes were heard on all sides live one shouted a man as a whistling shell approachedot this way o the infantry added another with loud laughterseeing the shell fly past and fall into the

the peasants they dont like itat allierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt and afterevery loss the liveliness increased more and mores the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly andrapidly from an approaching thundercloud so as if in opposition towhat was taking place the lightning of hidden fire growing more andmore intense glowed in the faces of these menierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to knowwhat was happening there he was entirely absorbed in watching this firewhich burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in thesame way in his own soult ten oclock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front ofthe battery and along the amenka streamlet retreated rom the batterythey could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on theirmuskets  general with his suite came to the battery and afterspeaking to the colonel gave ierre an angry look and went away againhaving ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down soas to be less exposed to fire fter this from amid the ranks ofinfantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shoutsof command and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantrymoved forwardierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck bya pale young officer who letting his sword hang down was walkingbackwards and kept glancing uneasily aroundhe ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their longdrawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard  fewminutes later crowds

nowheard nothing else n the right of the battery soldiers shoutingurrah were running not forwards but backwards it seemed to ierre cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he wasstanding crumbling down the earth a black ball flashed before his eyesand at the same instant plumped into something ome militiamen who wereentering the battery ran backll with grapeshot shouted the officerhe sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informedhim as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more ofsome wine asked for that there were no more

cannon ball another and a third flew over him falling in frontbeside and behind him ierre ran down the slope here am  goinghe suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunitionwagons e halted irresolutely not knowing whether to return or go onuddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground t thesame instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame and immediately adeafening roar crackling and whistling made his ears tinglehen he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on hishands the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existedonly charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass and ahorse dangling fragments of its shaft behind it galloped past whileanother horse lay like ierre on the ground uttering prolonged andpiercing cries eside himself with terror ierre jumped up and ran back to the batteryas to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded himn entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing somethingthere but that no shots were being fired from the battery e had notime to realize who these men were e saw the senior officer lying onthe earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining somethingdown below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before wasstruggling forward shouting rothers and trying to free himself fromsome men who were holding him by the arm e also saw something elsethat was strangeut he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed thatthe soldier shouting rothers was a prisoner and that another manhad been bayoneted in the back before his eyes for hardly had he runinto the redoubt before a thin sallowfaced perspiring man in a blueuniform rushed on him sword in hand shouting something nstinctivelyguarding against the shockfor they had been running together at fullspeed before they saw one anotherierre put out his hands and seizedthe man a rench officer by the shoulder with one hand and by thethroat with the other he officer dropping his sword seized ierre byhis collaror some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one anothersunfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and whatthey were to do next m  taken prisoner or have  taken himprisoner each was thinking ut the rench officer was evidently moreinclined to think he had been taken prisoner because ierres stronghand impelled by instinctive fear squeezed his throat ever tighter andtighter he renchman was about to say something when just above theirheads terrible and low a cannon ball whistled and it seemed to ierrethat the rench officers head had been torn off so swiftly had heducked itierre too bent his head and let his hands fall ithout further thoughtas to who had taken whom prisoner the renchman ran back to the batteryand ierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded whoit seemed to him caught at his feet ut before he reached the foot ofthe knoll he was met by a dense crowd of ussian soldiers whostumbling tripping up and shouting ran merrily and wildly toward thebattery his was the attack for which rmolov claimed the creditdeclaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possibleit was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some t eorgesrosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers totake who got therehe rench who had occupied the battery fled and our troops shoutingurrah pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficultto call them backhe prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was awounded rench general whom the officers surrounded rowds of woundedsome known to ierre and some unknownussians and rench with facesdistorted by suffering walked crawled and were carried on stretchersfrom the battery ierre again went up onto the knoll where he had spentover an hour and of that family circle which had received him as amember he did not find a single one here were many dead whom he didnot know but some he recognized he young officer still sat in thesame way bent double in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth wallhe redfaced man was still twitching but they did not carry him awayierre ran down the slope once moreow they will stop it now they will be horrified at what they havedone he thought aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearersmoving from the battlefieldut behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high and in front andespecially to the left near emenovsk something seemed to be seethingin the smoke and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish buteven increased to desperation like a man who straining himself shriekswith all his remaining strength he chief action of the battle of orodino was fought within the seventhousand feet between orodino and agrations fleches eyond thatspace there was on the one side a demonstration made by the ussianswith varovs cavalry at midday and on the other side beyond titsaoniatowskis collision with uchkov but these two were detached andfeeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of thebattlefield n the field between orodino and the fleches beside thewood the chief action of the day took place on an open space visiblefrom both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless wayhe battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundredgunshen when the whole field was covered with smoke two divisionsampans and essaixs advanced from the rench right while uratstroops advanced on orodino from their leftrom the hevardino edoubt where apoleon was standing the fleches weretwo thirds of a mile away and it was more than a mile as the crow fliesto orodino so that apoleon could not see what was happening thereespecially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole localityhe soldiers of essaixs division advancing against the fleches couldonly be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them andthe fleches s soon as they had descended into that hollow the smokeof the guns and musketry on the fleches grew so dense that it coveredthe whole approach on that side of it hrough the smoke glimpses couldbe caught of something blackprobably menand at times the glint ofbayonets ut whether they were moving or stationary whether they wererench or ussian could not be discovered from the hevardino edoubthe sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight intoapoleons face as shading his eyes with his hand he looked at thefleches he smoke spread out before them and at times it looked as ifthe smoke were moving at times as if the troops moved ometimes shoutswere heard through the firing but it was impossible to tell what wasbeing done thereapoleon standing on the knoll looked through a field glass and inits small circlet saw smoke and men sometimes his own and sometimesussians but when he looked again with the naked eye he could not tellwhere what he had seen wase descended the knoll and began walking up and down before itccasionally he stopped listened to the firing and gazed intently atthe battlefieldut not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from wherehe was standing down below or from the knoll above on which some of hisgenerals had taken their stand but even from the fleches themselvesinwhich by this time there were now ussian and now rench soldiersalternately or together dead wounded alive frightened or maddenedeven at those fleches themselves it was impossible to make out what wastaking place here for several hours amid incessant cannon and musketryfire now ussians were seen alone now renchmen alone now infantryand now cavalry they appeared fired fell collided not knowing whatto do with one another screamed and ran back againrom the battlefield adjutants he had sent out and orderlies from hismarshals kept galloping up to apoleon with reports of the progress ofthe action but all these reports were false both because it wasimpossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any givenmoment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual placeof conflict but reported what they had heard from others and alsobecause while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to apoleoncircumstances changed and the news he brought was already becomingfalse hus an adjutant galloped up from urat with tidings thatorodino had been occupied and the bridge over the olocha was in thehands of the rench he adjutant asked whether apoleon wished thetroops to cross it apoleon gave orders that the troops should form upon the farther side and wait ut before that order was givenalmost assoon in fact as the adjutant had left orodinothe bridge had beenretaken by the ussians and burned in the very skirmish at which ierrehad been present at the beginning of the battlen adjutant galloped up from the fleches with a pale and frightened faceand reported to apoleon that their attack had been repulsed ampanwounded and avout killed yet at the very time the adjutant had beentold that the rench had been repulsed the fleches had in fact beenrecaptured by other rench troops and avout was alive and onlyslightly bruised n the basis of these necessarily untrustworthyreports apoleon gave his orders which had either been executed beforehe gave them or could not be and were not executedhe marshals and generals who were nearer to the field of battle butlike apoleon did not take part in the actual fighting and onlyoccasionally went within musket range made their own arrangementswithout asking apoleon and issued orders where and in what direction tofire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run ut eventheir orders like apoleons were seldom carried out and then butpartially or the most part things happened contrary to their ordersoldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot soldiersordered to remain where they were suddenly seeing ussiansunexpectedly before them sometimes rushed back and sometimes forwardand the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying ussiansn this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the emenovsk hollowand as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round andgalloped full speed back again he infantry moved in the same waysometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered togo to ll orders as to where and when to move the guns when to sendinfantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the ussian infantryallsuch orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the unitsconcerned without asking either ey avout or urat much lessapoleon hey did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfillingorders or for acting on their own initiative for in battle what is atstake is what is dearest to manhis own lifeand it sometimes seemsthat safety lies in running back sometimes in running forward andthese men who were right in the heat of the battle acted according tothe mood of the moment n reality however all these movements forwardand backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops lltheir rushing and galloping at one another did little harm the harm ofdisablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew overthe fields on which these men were floundering about s soon as theyleft the place where the balls and bullets were flying about theirsuperiors located in the background reformed them and brought themunder discipline and under the influence of that discipline led themback to the zone of fire where under the influence of fear of deaththey lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chancepromptings of the throng apoleons generalsavout ey and urat who were near that regionof fire and sometimes even entered itrepeatedly led into it hugemasses of wellordered troops ut contrary to what had always happenedin their former battles instead of the news they expected of theenemys flight these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized andterrified mobs he generals reformed them but their numbersconstantly decreased n the middle of the day urat sent his adjutantto apoleon to demand reinforcementsapoleon sat at the foot of the knoll drinking punch when uratsadjutant galloped up with an assurance that the ussians would be routedif is ajesty would let him have another divisioneinforcements said apoleon in a tone of stern surprise looking atthe adjutanta handsome lad with long black curls arranged like uratsownas though he did not understand his wordseinforcements thought apoleon to himself ow can they needreinforcements when they already have half the army directed against aweak unentrenched ussian wingell the ing of aples said he sternly that it is not noon yetand  dont yet see my chessboard clearly ohe handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply withoutremoving his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were beingslaughteredapoleon rose and having summoned aulaincourt and erthier begantalking to them about matters unconnected with the battlen the midst of this conversation which was beginning to interestapoleon erthiers eyes turned to look at a general with a suite whowas galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse t was elliardaving dismounted he went up to the mperor with rapid strides and in aloud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sendingreinforcements e swore on his honor that the ussians were lost if themperor would give another divisionapoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and downwithout replying elliard began talking loudly and eagerly to thegenerals of the suite around himou are very fiery elliard said apoleon when he again came up tothe general n the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake oand have another look and then come back to meefore elliard was out of sight a messenger from another part of thebattlefield galloped upow then what do you want asked apoleon in the tone of a manirritated at being continually disturbedire the prince began the adjutantsks for reinforcements said apoleon with an angry gesturehe adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report but themperor turned from him took a couple of steps stopped came back andcalled erthiere must give reserves he said moving his arms slightly apart hodo you think should be sent there he asked of erthier whom hesubsequently termed that gosling  have made an eagleend laparedes division sire replied erthier who knew all thedivisions regiments and battalions by heartapoleon nodded assenthe adjutant galloped to laparedes division and a few minutes laterthe oung uards stationed behind the knoll moved forward apoleongazed silently in that directiono he suddenly said to erthier  cant send laparede endriants divisionhough there was no advantage in sending riants division instead oflaparedes and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stoppinglaparede and sending riant now the order was carried out exactlyapoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing thepart of a doctor who hinders by his medicinesa role he so justlyunderstood and condemnedriants division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke ofthe battlefield rom all sides adjutants continued to arrive at agallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing hey all askedfor reinforcements and all said that the ussians were holding theirpositions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the rench army wasmelting awayapoleon sat on a campstool wrapped in thought de eausset the man so fond of travel having fasted since morningcame up to the mperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to isajesty hope  may now congratulate our ajesty on a victory said heapoleon silently shook his head in negation ssuming the negation torefer only to the victory and not to the lunch  de eausset venturedwith respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for nothaving lunch when one can get ito away exclaimed apoleon suddenly and morosely and turned aside beatific smile of regret repentance and ecstasy beamed on  deeaussets face and he glided away to the other generalsapoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an everlucky gambler who after recklessly flinging money about and alwayswinning suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of thegame finds that the more he considers his play the more surely helosesis troops were the same his generals the same the same preparationshad been made the same dispositions and the same proclamation courteet energique he himself was still the same he knew that and knew thathe was now even more experienced and skillful than before ven theenemy was the same as at usterlitz and riedlandyet the terriblestroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotentll the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success theconcentration of batteries on one point an attack by reserves to breakthe enemys line and a cavalry attack by the men of iron all thesemethods had already been employed yet not only was there no victorybut from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded ofreinforcements needed of the impossibility of driving back theussians and of disorganization among his own troopsormerly after he had given two or three orders and uttered a fewphrases marshals and adjutants had come galloping up withcongratulations and happy faces announcing the trophies taken thecorps of prisoners bundles of enemy eagles and standards cannon andstores and urat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gatherin the baggage wagons o it had been at odi arengo rcola enausterlitz agram and so on ut now something strange was happeningto his troopsespite news of the capture of the fleches apoleon saw that this wasnot the same not at all the same as what had happened in his formerbattles e saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men abouthim experienced in the art of war ll their faces looked dejected andthey all shunned one anothers eyesonly a de eausset could fail tograsp the meaning of what was happeningut apoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of abattle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours after allefforts had been expended e knew that it was a lost battle and thatthe least accident might nowwith the fight balanced on such a strainedcenterdestroy him and his armyhen he ran his mind over the whole of this strange ussian campaign inwhich not one battle had been won and in which not a flag or cannonor army corps had been captured in two months when he looked at theconcealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of theussians still holding their grounda terrible feeling like a nightmaretook possession of him and all the unlucky accidents that might destroyhim occurred to his mind he ussians might fall on his left wingmight break through his center he himself might be killed by a straycannon ball ll this was possible n former battles he had onlyconsidered the possibilities of success but now innumerable unluckychances presented themselves and he expected them all es it was likea dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack himand raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knowsshould annihilate him but then feels that his arm drops powerless andlimp like a rag and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him inhis helplessnesshe news that the ussians were attacking the left flank of the rencharmy aroused that horror in apoleon e sat silently on a campstoolbelow the knoll with head bowed and elbows on his knees erthierapproached and suggested that they should ride along the line toascertain the position of affairshat hat do you say asked apoleon es tell them to bring me myhorsee mounted and rode toward emenovskmid the powder smoke slowly dispersing over the whole space throughwhich apoleon rode horses and men were lying in pools of blood singlyor in heaps either apoleon nor any of his generals had ever beforeseen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area he roar ofguns that had not ceased for ten hours wearied the ear and gave apeculiar significance to the spectacle as music does to tableauxvivants apoleon rode up the high ground at emenovsk and through thesmoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him heywere ussianshe ussians stood in serried ranks behind emenovsk village and itsknoll and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent forthclouds of smoke t was no longer a battle it was a continuousslaughter which could be of no avail either to the rench or theussians apoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reveriefrom which erthier had aroused him e could not stop what was going onbefore him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and todepend on him and from its lack of success this affair for the firsttime seemed to him unnecessary and horriblene of the generals rode up to apoleon and ventured to offer to leadthe ld uard into action ey and erthier standing near apoleonexchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this generals senselessofferapoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long timet eight hundred leagues from rance  will not have my uarddestroyed he said and turning his horse rode back to hevardino n the rugcovered bench where ierre had seen him in the morning satutuzov his gray head hanging his heavy body relaxed e gave noorders but only assented to or dissented from what others suggestedes yes do that he replied to various proposals es yes godear boy and have a look he would say to one or another of thoseabout him or o dont wed better wait e listened to the reportsthat were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demandedthat of him but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he werenot interested in the import of the words spoken but rather insomething elsein the expression of face and tone of voice of those whowere reporting y long years of military experience he knew and withthe wisdom of age understood that it is impossible for one man todirect hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death and heknew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of acommanderinchief nor the place where the troops are stationed nor bythe number of cannon or of slaughtered men but by that intangible forcecalled the spirit of the army and he watched this force and guided itin as far as that was in his powerutuzovs general expression was one of concentrated quiet attentionand his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to masterthe fatigue of his old and feeble bodyt eleven oclock they brought him news that the fleches captured by therench had been retaken but that rince agration was wounded utuzovgroaned and swayed his headide over to rince eter vanovich and find out about it exactly hesaid to one of his adjutants and then turned to the uke of urttembergwho was standing behind himill our ighness

whocame from the field of battle and of those who stood around himutuzov noticed an expression of extreme tension e was satisfied withthe days successa success exceeding his expectations but the oldmans strength was failing him everal times his head dropped low as ifit were falling and he dozed off inner was brought himdjutant eneral olzogen the man who when riding past rince ndrewhad said the war should be extended widely and whom agration sodetested rode up while utuzov was at dinner olzogen had come fromarclay de olly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flankhe sagacious arclay de olly seeing crowds of wounded men runningback and the disordered rear of the army weighed all the circumstancesconcluded that the battle was lost and sent his favorite officer to thecommander in chief with that newsutuzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glancedat olzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lidsolzogen nonchalantly stretching his legs approached utuzov with ahalfcontemptuous smile on his lips scarcely touching the peak of hiscape treated his erene ighness with a somewhat affected nonchalanceintended to show that as a highly trained military man he left it toussians to make an idol of this useless old man but that he knew whomhe was dealing with er alte err as in their own set the ermanscalled utuzov is making himself very comfortable thought olzogenand looking severely at the dishes in front of utuzov he began toreport to the old gentleman the position of affairs on the left flankas arclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understooditll the points of our position are in the enemys hands and we cannotdislodge them for lack of troops the men are running away and it isimpossible to stop them he reportedutuzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on olzogen as ifnot understanding what was said to him olzogen noticing the oldgentlemans agitation said with a smile have not considered it right to conceal from your erene ighnesswhat  have seen he troops are in complete disorderou have seen ou have seen utuzov shouted rowning and risingquickly he went up to olzogenow how dare you he shouted choking and making a threateninggesture with his trembling arms ow dare you sir say that to me ouknow nothing about it ell eneral arclay from me that his informationis incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known tome the commanderinchief than to himolzogen was about to make a rejoinder but utuzov interrupted himhe enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the rightflank f you have seen amiss sir do not allow yourself to say whatyou dont know e so good as to ride to eneral arclay and inform himof my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow said utuzovsternlyll were silent and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing ofthe panting old generalhey are repulsed everywhere for which  thank od and our brave armyhe enemy is beaten and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacredsoil of ussia said utuzov crossing himself and he suddenly sobbedas his eyes filled with tearsolzogen shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips stepped silentlyaside marveling at the old gentlemans conceited stupidityh here he is my hero said utuzov to a portly handsome darkhaired general who was just ascending the knollhis was aevski who had spent the whole day at the most important partof the field of orodinoaevski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground andthat the rench no longer ventured to attackfter hearing him utuzov said in renchhen you do not think like some others that we must retreatn the contrary your ighness in indecisive actions it is always themost stubborn who remain victors replied aevski and in myopinionaysarov utuzov called to his adjutant it down and write out theorder of the day for tomorrow nd you he continued addressinganother ride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attackhile utuzov was talking to aevski and dictating the order of the dayolzogen returned from arclay and said that eneral arclay wished tohave written confirmation of the order the field marshal had givenutuzov without looking at olzogen gave directions for the order tobe written out which the former commanderinchief to avoid personalresponsibility very judiciously wished to receivend by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintainsthroughout an army one and the same temper known as the spirit of thearmy and which constitutes the sinew of war utuzovs words hisorder for a battle next day immediately became known from one end ofthe army to the othert was far from being the same words or the same order that reached thefarthest links of that chain he tales passing from mouth to mouth atdifferent ends of the army did not even resemble what utuzov had saidbut the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said wasnot the outcome of cunning calculations but of a feeling that lay inthe commanderinchiefs soul as in that of every ussiannd on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy and hearingfrom the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believethe exhausted wavering men felt comforted and inspirited rince ndrews regiment was among the reserves which till after oneoclock were stationed inactive behind emenovsk under heavy

officers orders the soldiers stood leaningagainst their stretchers and gazing intently as if trying to comprehendthe difficult problem of what was taking place before them rom thetents came now loud

there stopped awaiting instructions rince ndrewopened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going onaround him e remembered the meadow the wormwood the field thewhirling black ball and his sudden rush of passionate love of life wosteps from him leaning against a branch and talking loudly andattracting general attention stood a tall handsome blackhairednoncommissioned officer with a bandaged head e had been wounded in thehead and leg by bullets round him eagerly listening to his talk acrowd of wounded and stretcherbearers was gatherede kicked him out from there so that he

there beenhere hy was  so reluctant to part with life here was something inthis life  did not and do not understand ne of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron holdinga cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his smallbloodstained hands so as not to smear it e raised his head and lookedabout him but above the level of the wounded men e evidently wanted alittle

just beencleared and which a dresser was washing down rince ndrew could notmake out distinctly what was in that tent he pitiful groans from allsides and the torturing pain in his thigh stomach and back distractedhim ll he saw about him merged into a general impression of nakedbleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent asa few weeks previously on that hot ugust day such bodies had filledthe dirty pond beside the molensk road es it was the same flesh thesame chair a canon the sight of which had even then filled him withhorror as by a presentimenthere were three operating tables in the tent wo were occupied and onthe third they placed rince ndrew or a little while he was leftalone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other twotables n the

and the woundbandaged ater was being sprinkled on his face s soon as rincendrew opened his eyes the doctor bent over kissed him silently on thelips and hurried awayfter the sufferings he had been enduring rince ndrew enjoyed ablissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time ll thebest and happiest moments of his lifeespecially his earliestchildhood when he used to be undressed and put to bed and when leaningover him his nurse sang him to sleep and he burying his head in thepillow felt happy in the mere consciousness of lifereturned to hismemory not merely as something past

ooh his frightened moans couldbe heard subdued by suffering and broken by sobsearing those moans rince ndrew wanted to weep hether because he wasdying without glory or because he was sorry to part with life orbecause of those memories of a childhood that could not return orbecause he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near himwas groaning so piteouslyhe felt like weeping

hate us love of our enemies yes that love which od preached onearth and which rincess ary taught me and  did not understandthatis what made me sorry to part with life that is what remained for mehad  lived ut now it is too late  know it he terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and woundedtogether with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twentygenerals he knew personally had been killed or wounded and theconsciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm produced anunexpected impression on apoleon who usually liked to look at thekilled and wounded thereby he considered testing his strength ofmind his day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame thatstrength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and hisgreatness e rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to thehevardino knoll where he sat on his campstool his sallow face swollenand heavy his eyes dim his nose red and his voice hoarseinvoluntarily listening with downcast eyes to the sounds of firingith painful dejection he awaited the end of this action in which heregarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest personal human feeling for a brief moment got the better of theartificial phantasm of life he had served so long e felt in his ownperson the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield heheaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility ofsuffering and death for himself t that moment he did not desireoscow or victory or glory what need had he for any more glory heone thing he wished for was rest tranquillity and freedom ut when hehad been on the emenovsk heights the artillery commander had proposedto him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights tostrengthen the fire on the ussian troops crowded in front of nyazkovoapoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be broughtto him of the effect those batteries producedn adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns hadbeen concentrated on the ussians as he had ordered but that theystill held their groundur fire is mowing them down by rows but still they hold on said theadjutanthey want more said apoleon in a hoarse voiceire asked the adjutant who had not heard the remarkhey want more croaked apoleon frowning et them have itven before he gave that order the thing he did not desire and forwhich he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of himwas being done nd he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginarygreatness and againas a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doingsomething for itselfhe submissively fulfilled the cruel sad gloomyand inhuman role predestined for himnd not for that day and hour alone were the mind and consciencedarkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happeninglay more than on all the others who took part in it ever to the end ofhis life could he understand goodness beauty or truth or thesignificance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness andtruth too remote from everything human for him ever to be able tograsp their meaning e could not disavow his actions belauded as theywere by half the world and so he had to repudiate truth goodness andall humanityot only on that day as he rode over the battlefield strewn with menkilled and maimed by his will as he believed did he reckon as helooked at them how many ussians there were for each renchman anddeceiving himself find reason for rejoicing in the calculation thatthere were five ussians for every renchman ot on that day alone didhe write in a letter to aris that the battle field was superbbecause fifty thousand corpses lay there but even on the island of telena in the peaceful solitude where

these men might have been seized with horror at what they weredoing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhereut though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror ofwhat they were doing though they would have been glad to leave offsome incomprehensible mysterious power continued to control them andthey still brought up the charges loaded aimed and applied the

rear of the ussian army would havesaid that if only the rench made one more slight effort it woulddisappear and anyone looking at the rear of the rench army would havesaid that the ussians need only make one more slight effort and therench would be destroyed ut neither the rench nor the ussians madethat effort and the flame of battle burned slowly outhe ussians did not make that effort because they were not attackingthe rench t the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the wayto oscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at thebeginning ut even had the aim of the ussians been to drive the renchfrom their positions they could not have made this last effort for allthe ussian troops had been broken up there was no part of the ussianarmy that had not suffered in the battle and though still holding theirpositions they had lost   of their armyhe rench with the memory of all their former victories during fifteenyears with the assurance of apoleons invincibility with theconsciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and hadlost only a quarter of their men and still had their uards intacttwenty thousand strong might easily have made that effort he renchwho had attacked the ussian army in order to drive it from its positionought to have made that effort for as long as the ussians continued toblock the road to oscow as before the aim of the rench had not beenattained and all their efforts and losses were in vain ut the renchdid not make that effort ome historians say that apoleon need onlyhave used his ld uards who were intact and the battle would havebeen won o speak of what would have happened had apoleon sent hisuards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring tcould not be apoleon did not give his uards not because he did notwant to but because it could not be done ll the generals officersand soldiers of the rench army knew it could not be done because theflagging spirit of the troops would not permit itt was not apoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling ofthe mighty arm being stricken powerless but all the generals andsoldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or notafter all their experience of previous battleswhen after one tenth ofsuch efforts the enemy had fledexperienced a similar feeling of terrorbefore an enemy who after losing  his men stood as threateninglyat the end as at the beginning of the battle he moral force of theattacking rench army was exhausted ot that sort of victory which isdefined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks calledstandards and of the ground on which the troops had stood and werestanding but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moralsuperiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by theussians at orodino he rench invaders like an infuriated animalthat has in its onslaught received a mortal wound felt that they wereperishing but could not stop any more than the ussian army weaker byone half could help swerving y impetus gained the rench army wasstill able to roll forward to oscow but there without further efforton the part of the ussians it had to perish bleeding from the mortalwound it had received at orodino he direct consequence of the battleof orodino was apoleons senseless flight from oscow his retreatalong the old molensk road the destruction of the invading army offive hundred thousand men and the downfall of apoleonic rance onwhich at orodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of strongerspirit had been laid   bsolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mindaws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when heexamines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion but at the sametime a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrarydivision of continuous motion into discontinuous elements here is awell known socalled sophism of the ancients consisting in this thatchilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following in spiteof the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise y thetime chilles has covered the distance that separated him from thetortoise the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead ofhim when chilles has covered that tenth the tortoise has coveredanother one hundredth and so on forever his problem seemed to theancients insoluble he absurd answer that chilles could neverovertake the tortoise resulted from this that motion was arbitrarilydivided into discontinuous elements whereas the motion both of chillesand of the tortoise was continuousy adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach asolution of the problem but never reach it nly when we have admittedthe conception of the infinitely small and the resulting geometricalprogression with a common ratio of one tenth and have found the sum ofthis progression to infinity do we reach a solution of the problem modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing withthe infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complexproblems of motion which used to appear insolublehis modern branch of mathematics unknown to the ancients when dealingwith problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely smalland so conforms to the chief condition of motion absolute continuityand thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannotavoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead ofexamining continuous motionn seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happenshe movement of humanity arising as it does from innumerable arbitraryhuman wills is continuouso understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim ofhistory ut to arrive at these laws resulting from the sum of allthose human wills mans mind postulates arbitrary and disconnectedunits he first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selectedseries of continuous events and examine it apart from others thoughthere is and can be no beginning to any event for one event alwaysflows uninterruptedly from anotherhe second method is to consider the actions of some one mana king ora commanderas equivalent to the sum of many individual wills whereasthe sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of asingle historic personageistorical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continuallytakes smaller and smaller units for examination ut however small theunits it takes we feel that to take any unit disconnected from othersor to assume a beginning of any phenomenon or to say that the will ofmany men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage isin itself falset needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductionsdrawn from history t is merely necessary to select some larger orsmaller unit as the subject of observationas criticism has every rightto do seeing that whatever unit history observes must always bearbitrarily selectednly by taking infinitesimally small units for observation thedifferential of history that is the individual tendencies of men andattaining to the art of integrating them that is finding the sum ofthese infinitesimals can we hope to arrive at the laws of historyhe first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in urope present anextraordinary movement of millions of people en leave their customarypursuits hasten from one side of urope to the other plunder andslaughter one another triumph and are plunged in despair and for someyears the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensivemovement which first increases and then slackens hat was the cause ofthis movement by what laws was it governed asks the mind of manhe historians replying to this question lay before us the sayings anddoings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of aris callingthese sayings and doings the evolution then they give a detailedbiography of apoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to himtell of the influence some of these people had on others and say thatis why this movement took place and those are its lawsut the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation butplainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious because init a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger he sum ofhuman wills produced the evolution and apoleon and only the sum ofthose wills first tolerated and then destroyed themut every time there have been conquests there have been conquerorsevery time there has been a revolution in any state there have beengreat men says history nd indeed human reason replies every timeconquerors appear there have been wars but this does not prove that theconquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of awar

only along that path does the possibility of discoveringthe laws of history lie and that as yet not a millionth part as muchmental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as hasbeen

he ussianarmy and people avoided a collision till molensk was reached and againfrom molensk to orodino he rench army pushed on to oscow itsgoal its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim just as thevelocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth ehindit were seven hundred miles of hungerstricken hostile country aheadwere a few dozen miles separating it from its goal very soldier inapoleons army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentumhe more the ussian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatredof the enemy flared up and while it retreated the army increased andconsolidated t orodino a collision took place either army wasbroken up but the ussian army retreated immediately after thecollision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with anotherhaving a greater momentum and with equal inevitability the ball ofinvasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for somedistance though the collision had deprived it of all its forcehe ussians retreated eighty milesto beyond oscowand the renchreached oscow and there came to a standstill or five weeks after thatthere was not a single battle he rench did not move s a bleedingmortally wounded animal licks its wounds they remained inert in oscowfor five weeks and then suddenly with no fresh reason fled back theymade a dash for the aluga road and after a victoryfor at aloaroslavets the field of conflict again remained theirs withoutundertaking a single serious battle they fled still more rapidly backto molensk beyond molensk beyond the erezina beyond ilna andfarther stilln the evening of the twentysixth of ugust utuzov and the wholeussian army were convinced that the battle of orodino was a victoryutuzov reported so to the mperor e gave orders to prepare for afresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyonebut because he knew that the enemy was beaten as everyone who had takenpart in the battle knew itut all that evening and next day reports came in one after another ofunheardof losses of the loss of half the army and a fresh battleproved physically impossiblet was impossible to give battle before information had been collectedthe wounded gathered in the supplies of ammunition replenished theslain reckoned up new officers appointed to replace those who had beenkilled and before the men had had food and sleep nd meanwhile thevery next morning after the battle the rench army advanced of itselfupon the ussians carried forward by the force of its own momentum nowseemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distancefrom its aim utuzovs wish was to attack next day and the whole armydesired to do so ut to make an attack the wish to do so is notsufficient there must also be a possibility of doing it and thatpossibility did not exist t was impossible not to retreat a daysmarch and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat anotherand a third days march and at last on the first of eptember when thearmy drew near oscowdespite the strength of the feeling that hadarisen in all ranksthe force of circumstances compelled it to retirebeyond oscow nd the troops retired one more last days march andabandoned oscow to the enemyor people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles aremade by generalsas any one of us sitting over a map in his study mayimagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battlethequestions present themselves hy did utuzov during the retreat not dothis or that hy did he not take up a position before reaching ilihy did he not retire at once by the aluga road abandoning oscow andso on eople accustomed to think in that way forget or do not knowthe inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of anycommander in chief he activity of a commanderinchief does not at allresemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in ourstudies examining some campaign on the map with a certain number oftroops on this and that side in a certain known locality and begin ourplans from some given moment  commanderinchief is never dealing withthe beginning of any eventthe position from which we alwayscontemplate it he commanderinchief is always in the midst of aseries of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider thewhole import of an event that is occurring oment by moment the eventis imperceptibly shaping itself and at every moment of this continuousuninterrupted shaping of events the commanderinchief is in the midstof a most complex play of intrigues worries contingenciesauthorities projects counsels threats and deceptions and iscontinually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to himwhich constantly conflict with one anotherearned military authorities quite seriously tell us that utuzov shouldhave moved his army to the aluga road long before reaching ili andthat somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him ut a commanderin chief especially at a difficult moment has always before him notone proposal but dozens simultaneously nd all these proposals basedon strategics and tactics contradict each other commanderinchiefs business it would seem is simply to choose oneof these projects ut even that he cannot do vents and time do notwait or instance on the twentyeighth it is suggested to him to crossto the aluga road but just then an adjutant gallops up fromiloradovich asking whether he is to engage the rench or retire norder must be given him at once that instant nd the order to retreatcarries us past the turn to the aluga road nd after the adjutantcomes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be takenand the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go and acourier from etersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which doesnot admit of the possibility of abandoning oscow and the commanderinchiefs rival the man who is undermining him and there are always notmerely one but several such presents a new project diametricallyopposed to that of turning to the aluga road and the commanderinchief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and arespectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution ofrewards comes to complain and the inhabitants of the district pray tobe defended and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in andgives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previouslysent and a spy a prisoner and a general who has been onreconnaissance all describe the position of the enemys armydifferently eople accustomed to misunderstand or to forget theseinevitable conditions of a commanderinchiefs actions describe to usfor instance the position of the army at ili and assume that thecommanderinchief could on the first of eptember quite freely decidewhether to abandon oscow or defend it whereas with the ussian armyless than four miles from oscow no such question existed hen hadthat question been settled t rissa and at molensk and most palpablyof all on the twentyfourth of ugust at hevardino and on the twentysixth at orodino and each day and hour and minute of the retreat fromorodino to ili hen rmolov having been sent by utuzov to inspect the position toldthe field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before oscowand that they must retreat utuzov looked at him in silenceive me your hand said he and turning it over so as to feel thepulse added ou are not well my dear fellow hink what you aresayingutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond oscowwithout a battlen the oklonny ill four miles from the orogomilov gate of oscowutuzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside great crowd of generals gathered round him and ount ostopchin whohad come out from oscow joined them his brilliant company separatedinto several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantagesof the position the state of the army the plans suggested thesituation of oscow and military questions generally hough they hadnot been summoned for the purpose and though it was not so called theyall felt that this was really a council of war he conversations alldealt with public questions f anyone gave or asked for personal newsit was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to generalmatters o jokes or laughter or smiles even were seen among allthese men hey evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at theheight the situation demanded nd all these groups while talking amongthemselves tried to keep near the commanderinchief whose benchformed the center of the gathering and to speak so that he mightoverhear them he commander in chief listened to what was being saidand sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks but did not himselftake part in the conversations or express any opinion fter hearingwhat was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turnedaway with an air of disappointment as though they were not speaking ofanything he wished to hear ome discussed the position that had beenchosen criticizing not the position itself so much as the mentalcapacity of those who had chosen it thers argued that a mistake hadbeen made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two daysbefore thers again spoke of the battle of alamanca which wasdescribed by rosart a newly arrived renchman in a panish uniformhis renchman and one of the erman princes serving with the ussianarmy were discussing the siege of aragossa and considering thepossibility of defending oscow in a similar manner ount ostopchinwas telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the citytrain bands under the walls of the capital but that he still could nothelp regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening andthat had he known it sooner things would have been different  fifthgroup displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptionsdiscussed the direction the troops would now have to take  sixth groupwas talking absolute nonsense utuzovs expression grew more and morepreoccupied and gloomy rom all this talk he saw only one thing thatto defend oscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning ofthose words that is to say so utterly impossible that if any senselesscommander were to give orders to fight confusion would result but thebattle would still not take place t would not take place because thecommanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible butin their conversations were only discussing what would happen after itsinevitable abandonment ow could the commanders lead their troops to afield of battle they considered impossible to hold he lowergradeofficers and even the soldiers who too reason also considered theposition impossible and therefore could not go to fight fully convincedas they were of defeat f ennigsen insisted on the position beingdefended and others still discussed it the question was no longerimportant in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intriguehis utuzov knew wellennigsen who had chosen the position warmly displayed his ussianpatriotism utuzov could not listen to this without wincing byinsisting that oscow must be defended is aim was as clear as daylightto utuzov if the defense failed to throw the blame on utuzov who hadbrought the army as far as the parrow ills without giving battle ifit succeeded to claim the success as his own or if battle were notgiven to clear himself of the crime of abandoning oscow ut thisintrigue did not now occupy the old mans mind ne terrible questionabsorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone hequestion for him now was ave  really allowed apoleon to reachoscow and when did  do so hen was it decided an it have beenyesterday when  ordered latov to retreat or was it the eveningbefore when  had a nap and told ennigsen to issue orders r was itearlier still hen when was this terrible affair decided oscowmust be abandoned he army must retreat and the order to do so must begiven o give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent toresigning the command of the army nd not only did he love power towhich he was accustomed the honours awarded to rince rozorovskiunder whom he had served in urkey galled him but he was convincedthat he was destined to save ussia and that that was why against themperors wish and by the will of the people he had been chosencommanderinchief e was convinced that he alone could maintaincommand of the army in these difficult circumstances and that in allthe world he alone could encounter the invincible apoleon without fearand he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue utsomething had to be decided and these conversations around him whichwere assuming too free a character must be stoppede called the most important generals to himy head be it good or bad must depend on itself said he risingfrom the bench and he rode to ili where his carriages were waiting he ouncil of ar began to assemble at two in the afternoon in thebetter and roomier part of ndrew avostyanovs hut he men women andchildren of the large peasant family crowded into the back room acrossthe passage nly alasha ndrews sixyearold granddaughter whom hiserene ighness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugarwhile drinking his tea remained on the top of the brick oven in thelarger room alasha looked down from the oven with shy delight at thefaces uniforms and decorations of the generals who one after anothercame into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner underthe icons randdad himself as alasha in her own mind calledutuzov sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven e sat sunk deepin a folding armchair and continually cleared his throat and pulled atthe collar of his coat which though it was unbuttoned still seemed topinch his neck hose who entered went up one by one to the fieldmarshal he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others is adjutantaysarov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facingutuzov but the latter moved his hand angrily and aysarov understoodthat his erene ighness did not wish his face to be seenound the peasants deal table on which lay maps plans pencils andpapers so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in anotherbench and put it beside the table rmolov aysarov and oll who hadjust arrived sat down on this bench n the foremost place immediatelyunder the icons sat arclay de olly his high forehead merging intohis bald crown e had a t eorges ross round his neck and lookedpale and ill e had been feverish for two days and was now shiveringand in pain eside him sat varov who with rapid gesticulations wasgiving him some information speaking in low tones as they all didhubby little okhturov was listening attentively with eyebrows raisedand arms folded on his stomach n the other side sat ount stermannolstoy seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts is broad head with itsbold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand aevskitwitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his habitglanced now at utuzov and now at the door with a look of impatienceonovnitsyns firm handsome and kindly face was lit up by a tendersly smile is glance met alashas and the expression of his eyescaused the little girl to smilehey were all waiting for ennigsen who on the pretext of inspectingthe position was finishing his savory dinner hey waited for him fromfour till six oclock and did not begin their deliberations all thattime but talked in low tones of other mattersnly when ennigsen had entered the hut did utuzov leave his corner anddraw toward the table but not near enough for the candles that had beenplaced there to light up his faceennigsen opened the council with the question re we to abandonussias ancient and sacred capital without a struggle or are we todefend it  prolonged and general silence followed here was a frownon every face and only utuzovs angry grunts and occasional cough brokethe silence ll eyes were gazing at him alasha too looked atranddad he was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered heseemed about to cry but this did not last longussias ancient and sacred capital he suddenly said repeatingennigsens words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to thefalse note in them llow me to tell you your excellency that thatquestion has no meaning for a ussian e lurched his heavy bodyforward uch a question cannot be put it is senseless he question have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one hequestion is that of saving ussia s it better to give up oscowwithout a battle or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as wellas oscow hat is the question on which  want your opinion and hesank back in his chairhe discussion began ennigsen did not yet consider his game lostdmitting the view of arclay and others that a defensive battle at iliwas impossible but imbued with ussian patriotism and the love ofoscow he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flankduring the night and attack the rench right flank the following daypinions were divided and arguments were advanced for and against thatproject rmolov okhturov and aevski agreed with ennigsen hetherfeeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capitalor guided by other personal considerations these generals seemed notto understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course ofevents and that oscow was in effect already abandoned he othergenerals however understood it and leaving aside the question ofoscow spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreatalasha who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before herunderstood the meaning of the council differently t seemed to her thatit was only a personal struggle between randdad and ongcoat asshe termed ennigsen he saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke toone another and in her heart she sided with randdad n the midst ofthe conversation she noticed randdad give ennigsen a quick subtleglance and then to her joys he saw that randdad said something toongcoat which settled him ennigsen suddenly reddened and pacedangrily up and down the room hat so affected him was utuzovs calmand quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of ennigsensproposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank toattack the rench right wingentlemen said utuzov  cannot approve of the counts plan ovingtroops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous and militaryhistory supports that view or instance utuzov seemed to reflectsearching for an example then with a clear naive look at ennigsen headded h yes take the battle of riedland which  think the countwell remembers and which was not fully successful only because ourtroops were rearranged too near the enemyhere followed a momentary pause which seemed very long to them allhe discussion recommenced but pauses frequently occurred and they allfelt that there was no more to be saiduring one of these pauses utuzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing tospeak hey all looked at himell gentlemen  see that it is  who will have to pay for the brokencrockery said he and rising slowly he moved to the table entlemen have heard your views ome of you will not agree with me ut  hepaused by the authority entrusted to me by my overeign and countryorder a retreatfter that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity andcircumspect silence of people who are leaving after a funeralome of the generals in low tones and in a strain very different fromthe way they had spoken during the council communicated something totheir commanderinchiefalasha who had long been expected for supper climbed carefullybackwards down from the oven her bare little feet catching at itsprojections and slipping between the legs of the generals she dartedout of the roomhen he had dismissed the generals utuzov sat a long time with hiselbows on the table thinking always of the same terrible questionhen when did the abandonment of oscow become inevitable hen wasthat done which settled the matter nd who was to blame for it did not expect this said he to his adjutant chneider when thelatter came in late that night  did not expect this  did not thinkthis would happenou should take some rest your erene ighness replied chneiderut no hey shall eat horseflesh yet like the urks exclaimedutuzov without replying striking the table with his podgy fist heyshall too if only t that very time in circumstances even more important than retreatingwithout a battle namely the evacuation and burning of oscowostopchin who is usually represented as being the instigator of thatevent acted in an altogether different manner from utuzovfter the battle of orodino the abandonment and burning of oscow wasas inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond oscow without fightingvery ussian might have predicted it not by reasoning but by thefeeling implanted in each of us and in our fathershe same thing that took place in oscow had happened in all the townsand villages on ussian soil beginning with molensk without theparticipation of ount ostopchin and his broadsheets he peopleawaited the enemy unconcernedly did not riot or become excited or tearanyone to pieces but faced its fate feeling within it the strength tofind what it should do at that most difficult moment nd as soon as theenemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their propertywhile the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was lefthe consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was andis present in the heart of every ussian nd a consciousness of thisand a foreboding that oscow would be taken was present in ussianoscow society in  hose who had quitted oscow already in uly andat the beginning of ugust showed that they expected this hose whowent away taking what they could and abandoning their houses and halftheir belongings did so from the latent patriotism which expressesitself not by phrases or by giving ones children to save the fatherlandand similar unnatural exploits but unobtrusively simply organicallyand therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful resultst is disgraceful to run away from danger only cowards are runningaway from oscow they were told n his broadsheets ostopchinimpressed on them that to leave oscow was shameful hey were ashamedto be called cowards ashamed to leave but still they left knowing ithad to be done hy did they go t is impossible to suppose thatostopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors apoleon hadcommitted in conquered countries he first people to go away were therich educated people who knew quite well that ienna and erlin hadremained intact and that during apoleons occupation the inhabitantshad spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming renchmenwhom the ussians and especially the ussian ladies then liked somuchhey went away because for ussians there could be no question as towhether things would go well or ill under rench rule in oscow t wasout of the question to be under rench rule it would be the worst thingthat could happen hey went away even before the battle of orodino andstill more rapidly after it despite ostopchins calls to defend oscowor the announcement of his intention to take the wonderworking icon ofthe berian other of od and go to fight or of the balloons that wereto destroy the rench and despite all the nonsense ostopchin wrote inhis broadsheets hey knew that it was for the army to fight and thatif it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and houseserfs to the hree ills quarter of oscow to fight apoleon and thatthey must go away sorry as they were to abandon their property todestruction hey went away without thinking of the tremendoussignificance of that immense and wealthy city being given over todestruction for a great city with wooden buildings was certain whenabandoned by its inhabitants to be burned hey went away each on hisown account and yet it was only in consequence of their going away thatthe momentous event was accomplished that will always remain thegreatest glory of the ussian people he lady who afraid of beingstopped by ount ostopchins orders had already in une moved with heregroes and her women jesters from oscow to her aratov estate with avague consciousness that she was not onapartes servant was reallysimply and truly carrying out the great work which saved ussia utount ostopchin who now taunted those who left oscow and now had thegovernment offices removed now distributed quite useless weapons to thedrunken rabble now had processions displaying the icons and nowforbade ather ugustin to remove icons or the relics of saints nowseized all the private carts in oscow and on one hundred

unavoidable eventthe abandonment and burning of oscowand tried with his puny hand nowto speed and now to stay the enormous popular tide that bore him alongwith it elene having returned with the court

intimacy with a young foreign prince hen she returned to etersburgboth the magnate and the prince were there and both claimed theirrights elene was faced by a new problemhow to preserve her intimacywith both without offending eitherhat would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman didnot cause the least embarrassment to ountess ezukhova who evidentlydeserved her reputation of being a very clever woman ad she attemptedconcealment or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position bycunning she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herselfguilty ut elene like a really great man who can do whatever hepleases at once assumed her own position to be correct as shesincerely believed it to be and that everyone else was to blamehe first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her shelifted her beautiful head and half turning to him said firmly hatsjust like a manselfish and cruel  expected nothing else  womansacrifices herself for you she suffers and this is her reward hatright have you monseigneur to demand an account of my attachments andfriendships e is a man who has been more than a father to me heprince was about to say something but elene interrupted himell yes said she it may be that he has other sentiments for methan those of a father but that is not a reason for me to shut my dooron him  am not a man that  should repay kindness with ingratitudenow monseigneur that in all that relates to my intimate feelings render account only to od and to my conscience she concluded layingher hand on her beautiful fully expanded bosom and looking up toheavenut for heavens sake listen to mearry me and  will be your slaveut thats impossibleou wont deign to demean yourself by marrying me you said elenebeginning to cryhe prince tried to comfort her but elene as if quite distraughtsaid through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marryingthat there were precedents there were up to that time very few but shementioned apoleon and some other exalted personages that she hadnever been her husbands wife and that she had been sacrificedut the law religion said the prince already yieldinghe law religion hat have they been invented for if they cantarrange that said elenehe prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to himand he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the ociety of esuswith whom he was on intimate terms few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which elene gave ather country house on the tone sland the charming onsieur de oberta man no longer young with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes aesuit a robe courte  was presented to her and in the garden by thelight of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for along time of the love of od of hrist of the acred eart and of theconsolations the one true atholic religion affords in this world andthe next elene was touched and more than once tears rose to her eyesand to those of onsieur de obert and their voices trembled  dancefor which her partner came to seek her put an end to her discourse withher future directeur de conscience but the next evening onsieur deobert came to see elene when she was alone and after that often cameagain ay member of the ociety of esusne day he took the countess to a oman atholic church where she kneltdown before the altar to which she was led he enchanting middleagedrenchman laid his hands on her head and as she herself afterwarddescribed it she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into hersoul t was explained to her that this was la gracefter that a longfrocked abbe was brought to her he confessed to himand he absolved her from her sins ext day she received a boxcontaining the acred ost which was left at her house for her topartake of  few days later elene learned with pleasure that she hadnow been admitted to the true atholic hurch and that in a few days theope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain documentll that was done around her and to her at this time all the attentiondevoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasantrefined ways and the state of dovelike purity she was now in she woreonly white dresses and white ribbons all that time gave her pleasurebut her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim ndas it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person getsthe better of cleverer ones elenehaving realized that the mainobject of all these words and all this trouble was after converting herto atholicism to obtain money from her for esuit institutions as towhich she received indicationsbefore parting with her money insistedthat the various operations necessary to free her from her husbandshould be performed n her view the aim of every religion was merely topreserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to humandesires nd with this aim in one of her talks with her atheronfessor she insisted on an answer to the question in how far was shebound by her marriagehey were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room hescent of flowers came in at the window elene was wearing a whitedress transparent over her shoulders and bosom he abbe a wellfedman with a plump cleanshaven chin a pleasant firm mouth and whitehands meekly folded on his knees sat close to elene and with a subtlesmile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beautyoccasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on thesubject elene with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and hisplump cleanshaven blackish cheeks and every moment expected theconversation to take a fresh turn ut the abbe though he evidentlyenjoyed the beauty of his companion was absorbed in his mastery of thematterhe course of the ather onfessors arguments ran as follows gnorantof the import of what you were undertaking you made a vow of conjugalfidelity to a man who on his part by entering the married state withoutfaith in the religious significance of marriage committed an act ofsacrilege hat marriage lacked the dual significance it should havehad et in spite of this your vow was binding ou swerved from ithat did you commit by so acting  venial or a mortal sin  venialsin for you acted without evil intention f now you married again withthe object of bearing children your sin might be forgiven ut thequestion is again a twofold one firstlyut suddenly elene who was getting bored said with one of herbewitching smiles ut  think that having espoused the true religion cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon mehe director of her conscience was astounded at having the casepresented to him thus with the simplicity of olumbus egg e wasdelighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupils progress but couldnot abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructedet us understand one another ountess said he with a smile andbegan refuting his spiritual daughters arguments elene understood that the question was very simple and easy from theecclesiastical point of view and that her directors were makingdifficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matterwould be regarded by the secular authoritieso she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of societyhe provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what shehad told her other suitor that is she put the matter so that the onlyway for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her he elderlymagnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriagewith a woman whose husband was alive as the younger man had been butelenes imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural asmarrying a maiden had its effect on him too ad elene herself shownthe least sign of hesitation shame or secrecy her cause wouldcertainly have been lost but not only did she show no signs of secrecyor shame on the contrary with goodnatured naivete she told herintimate friends and these were all etersburg that both the princeand the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and wasafraid of grieving either rumor immediately spread in etersburg not that elene wanted to bedivorced from her husband had such a report spread many would haveopposed so illegal an intention but simply that the unfortunate andinteresting elene was in doubt which of the two men she should marryhe question was no longer whether this was possible but only which wasthe better match and how the matter would be regarded at court herewere it is true some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height ofsuch a question who saw in the project a desecration of the sacramentof marriage but there were not many such and they remained silentwhile the majority were interested in elenes good fortune and in thequestion which match would be the more advantageous hether it wasright or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did notdiscuss for that question had evidently been settled by people wiserthan you or me as they said and to doubt the correctness of thatdecision would be to risk exposing ones stupidity and incapacity tolive in societynly arya mitrievna khrosimova who had come to etersburg thatsummer to see one of her sons allowed herself plainly to express anopinion contrary to the general one eeting elene at a ball shestopped her in the middle of the room and

made his way through a gully tonyazkovo with a crowd of soldiers reached the dressing station andseeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on still entangled inthe crowds of soldiershe one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quicklyfrom the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and returnto ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his ownbed e felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he beable to understand himself and all he had seen and felt ut suchordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be foundhough shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which hewas going still on all sides there was what there had been on the fieldof battle here were still the same suffering exhausted and sometimesstrangely indifferent faces the same blood the same soldiersovercoats the same sounds of firing which though distant now stillaroused terror and besides this there were the foul air and the dustaving gone a couple of miles along the ozhaysk road ierre sat downby the roadsideusk had fallen and the roar of guns died away ierre lay leaning onhis elbow for a long time gazing at the shadows that moved past him inthe darkness e was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flyingtoward him with a terrific whizz and then he shuddered and sat up ehad no idea how long he had been there n the middle of the night threesoldiers having brought some firewood settled down near him and beganlighting a firehe soldiers who threw sidelong glances at ierre got the fire to burnand placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread andput a little dripping he pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled withthe smell of smoke ierre sat up and sighed he three soldiers wereeating and

with his groom toward the inn ought to give them something he thought and felt in his pocketo better not said another inner voicehere was not a room to be had at the inn they were all occupiedierre went out into the yard and covering himself up head and all laydown in his carriage carcely had ierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himselffalling asleep but suddenly almost with the distinctness of realityhe heard the boom boom boom of firing the thud of projectiles groansand cries and smelled blood and powder and a feeling of horror anddread of death seized him illed with fright he opened his eyes andlifted his head from under his cloak ll was tranquil in the yard nlysomeones orderly passed through the gateway splashing through the mudand talked to the innkeeper bove ierres head some pigeons disturbedby the movement he had made in sitting up fluttered under the dark roofof the penthouse he whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peacefulsmell of stable yards delightful to ierre at that moment e could seethe clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouseshank od there is no more of that he thought covering up his headagain h what a terrible thing is fear and how shamefully  yieldedto it ut they they were steady and calm all the time to theend thought hehey in ierres mind were the soldiers those who had been at thebattery those who had given him food and those who had prayed beforethe icon hey those strange men he had not previously known stood outclearly and sharply from everyone elseo be a soldier just a soldier thought ierre as he fell asleep toenter communal life completely to be imbued by what makes them whatthey are ut how cast off all the superfluous devilish burden of myouter man here was a time when  could have done it  could have runaway from my father as  wanted to r  might have been sent to serveas a soldier after the duel with olokhov nd the memory of the dinnerat the nglish lub when he had challenged olokhov flashed throughierres mind and then he remembered his benefactor at orzhok nd nowa picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mindt was taking place at the nglish lub and someone near and dear to himsat at the end of the table es that is he t is my benefactor uthe died thought ierre es he died and  did not know he wasalive ow sorry  am that he died and how glad  am that he is aliveagain n one side of the table sat natole olokhov esvitskienisov and others like them in his dream the category to which thesemen belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of thosehe termed they and he heard those people natole and olokhovshouting and singing loudly yet through their shouting the voice of hisbenefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his wordswas as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield butpleasant and comforting ierre did not understand what his benefactorwas saying but he knew the categories of thoughts were also quitedistinct in his dream that he was talking of goodness and thepossibility of being what they were nd they with their simple kindfirm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides ut though they werekindly they did not look at ierre and did not know him ishing tospeak and to attract their attention he got up but at that moment hislegs grew cold and baree felt ashamed and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloakhad in fact slipped or a moment as he was rearranging his cloak ierreopened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs posts and yard butnow they were all bluish lit up and glittering with frost or dewt is dawn thought ierre ut thats not what  want  want tohear and understand my benefactors words gain he covered himself upwith his cloak but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was therehere were only thoughts clearly expressed in words thoughts thatsomeone was uttering or that he himself was formulatingfterwards when he recalled those thoughts ierre was convinced thatsomeone outside himself had spoken them though the impressions of thatday had evoked them e had never it seemed to him been able to thinkand express his thoughts like that when awakeo endure war is the most difficult subordination of mans freedom tothe law of od the voice had said implicity is submission to thewill of od you cannot escape from im nd they are simple hey donot talk but act he spoken word is silver but the unspoken is goldenan can be master of nothing while he fears death but he who does notfear it possesses all f there were no suffering man would not knowhis limitations would not know himself he hardest thing ierre wenton thinking or hearing in his dream is to be able in your soul tounite the meaning of all o unite all he asked himself o not tounite houghts cannot be united but to harness all these thoughtstogether is what we need es one must harness them must harnessthem he repeated to himself with inward rapture feeling that thesewords and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved thequestion that tormented himes one must harness it is time to harnessime to harness time to harness your excellency our excellencysome voice was repeating e must harness it is time to harnesst was the voice of the groom trying to wake him he sun shonestraight into ierres face e glanced at the dirty innyard in themiddle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pumpwhile carts were passing out of the gate ierre turned away withrepugnance and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seato  dont want that  dont want to see and understand that  wantto understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream ne secondmore and  should have understood it all ut what am  to do arnessbut how can  harness everything and ierre felt with horror that themeaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyedhe groom the coachman and the innkeeper told ierre that an officerhad come with news that the rench were already near ozhaysk and thatour men were leaving itierre got up and having told them to harness and overtake him went onfoot through the townhe troops were moving on leaving about ten

him that evening the secretary of a committee the colonelof his battalion his steward his majordomo and various petitionershey all had business with ierre and wanted decisions from him ierredid not understand and was not interested in any of these questions andonly answered them in order to get rid of these people hen left aloneat last he opened and read his wifes letterhey the soldiers at the battery rince ndrew killed that oldman implicity is submission to od uffering is necessary themeaning of all one must harness my wife is getting married nemust forget and understand nd going to his bed he threw himself onit without undressing and immediately fell asleephen he awoke next morning the majordomo came to inform him that aspecial messenger a police officer had come from ount ostopchin toknow whether ount ezukhov had left or was leaving the town dozen persons who had business with ierre were awaiting him in thedrawing room ierre dressed hurriedly and instead of going to seethem went to the back porch and out through the gaterom that time till the end of the destruction of oscow no one ofezukhovs household despite all the search they made saw ierre againor knew where he was he ostovs remained in oscow till the first of eptember that istill the eve of the enemys entry into the cityfter etya had joined bolenskis regiment of ossacks and left forelaya serkov where that regiment was forming the countess was seizedwith terror he thought that both her sons were at the war had bothgone from under her wing that today or tomorrow either or both of themmight be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances struckher that summer for the first time with cruel clearness he tried toget icholas back and wished to go herself to join etya or to get himan appointment somewhere in etersburg but neither of these provedpossible etya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless hewas transferred to another regiment on active service icholas wassomewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letterin which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with rincessary he countess did not sleep at night or when she did fall asleepdreamed that she saw her sons lying dead fter many consultations andconversations the count at last devised means to tranquillize her egot etya transferred from bolenskis regiment to ezukhovs which wasin training near oscow hough etya would remain in the service thistransfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least oneof her sons under her wing and she hoped to arrange matters for heretya so as not to let him go again but always get him appointed toplaces where he could not possibly take part in a battle s long asicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved herfirstborn more than all her other children and even reproached herselffor it but when her youngest the scapegrace who had been bad atlessons was always breaking things in the house and making himself anuisance to everybody that snubnosed etya with his merry black eyesand fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to showwhenhe was thrown amid those big dreadful cruel men who were fightingsomewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in itthenhis mother thought she loved him more much more than all her otherchildren he nearer the time came for etya to return the more uneasygrew the countess he began to think she would never live to see suchhappiness he presence of onya of her beloved atasha or even of herhusband irritated her hat do  want with them  want no one butetya she thoughtt the end of ugust the ostovs received another letter from icholase wrote from the province of oronezh where he had been sent to procureremounts but that letter did not set the countess at ease nowing thatone son was out of danger she became the more anxious about etyahough by the twentieth of ugust nearly all the ostovs acquaintanceshad left oscow and though everybody tried to persuade the countess toget away as quickly as possible she would not hear of leaving beforeher treasure her adored etya returned n the twentyeighth of ugusthe arrived he passionate tenderness with which his mother received himdid not please the sixteenyearold officer hough she concealed fromhim her intention of keeping him under her wing etya guessed herdesigns and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotionwhen with hermight become womanish as he termed it to himselfhetreated her coldly avoided her and during his stay in oscow attachedhimself exclusively to atasha for whom he had always had a particularlybrotherly tenderness almost loverlikewing to the counts customary carelessness nothing was ready for theirdeparture by the twentyeighth of ugust and the carts that were to comefrom their yazan and oscow estates to remove their householdbelongings did not arrive till the thirtiethrom the twentyeighth till the thirtyfirst all oscow was in a bustleand commotion very day thousands of men wounded at orodino werebrought in by the orogomilov gate and taken to various parts of oscowand thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessionsout by the other gates n spite of ostopchins broadsheets or becauseof them or independently of them the strangest and most contradictoryrumors were current in the town ome said that no one was to be allowedto leave the city others on the contrary said that all the icons hadbeen taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leaveome said there had been another battle after orodino at which therench had been routed while others on the contrary reported that theussian army had been destroyed ome talked about the oscow militiawhich preceded by the clergy would go to the hree ills otherswhispered that ugustin had been forbidden to leave that traitors hadbeen seized that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on theirway from oscow and so on ut all this was only talk in realitythough the ouncil of ili at which it was decided to abandon oscowhad not yet been held both those who went away and those who remainedbehind felt though they did not show it that oscow would certainly beabandoned and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible andsave their belongings t was felt that everything would suddenly breakup and change but up to the first of eptember nothing had done so sa criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must dieimmediately but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that isawry on his head so oscow involuntarily continued its wonted lifethough it knew that the time of its destruction was near when theconditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit wouldbe completely upseturing the three days preceding the occupation of oscow the wholeostov family was absorbed in various activities he head of thefamily ount lya ostov continually drove about the city collectingthe current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty ordersat home about the preparations for their departurehe countess watched the things being packed was dissatisfied witheverything was constantly in pursuit of etya who was always runningaway from her and was jealous of atasha with whom he spent all histime onya alone directed the practical side of matters by gettingthings packed ut of late onya had been particularly sad and silenticholas letter in which he mentioned rincess ary had elicited inher presence joyous comments from the countess who saw an interventionof rovidence in this meeting of the princess and icholas was never pleased at olkonskis engagement to atasha said thecountess but  always wanted icholas to marry the princess and had apresentiment that it would happen hat a good thing it would beonya felt that this was true that the only possibility of retrievingthe ostovs affairs was by icholas marrying a rich woman and that theprincess was a good match t was very bitter for her ut despite hergrief or perhaps just because of it she took on herself all thedifficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things andwas busy for whole days he count and countess turned to her when theyhad any orders to give etya and atasha on the contrary far fromhelping their parents were generally a nuisance and a hindrance toeveryone lmost all day long the house resounded with their runningfeet their cries and their spontaneous laughter hey laughed and weregay not because there was any reason to laugh but because gaiety andmirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a causefor gaiety and laughter to them etya was in high spirits becausehaving left home a boy he had returned as everybody told him a fineyoung man because he was at home because he had left elaya serkovwhere there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come tooscow where there was to be fighting in a few days and chiefly becauseatasha whose lead he always followed was in high spirits atasha wasgay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her ofthe cause of her sadness and because she was feeling well he was alsohappy because she had someone to adore her the adoration of others wasa lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freelyand etya adored her bove all they were gay because there was a warnear oscow there would be fighting at the town gates arms were beinggiven out everybody was escapinggoing away somewhere and in generalsomething extraordinary was happening and that is always excitingespecially to the young n aturday the thirtyfirst of ugust everything in the ostovshouse seemed topsyturvy ll the doors were open all the furniture wasbeing carried out or moved about and the mirrors and pictures had beentaken down here were trunks in the rooms and hay wrapping paper andropes were scattered about he peasants and house serfs carrying outthe things were treading heavily on the parquet floors he yard wascrowded with peasant carts some loaded high and already corded upothers still emptyhe voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants whohad come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in theyard and in the house he count had been out since morning hecountess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and waslying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her headetya was not at home he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meantto obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army onya was inthe ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china atashawas sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses ribbonsand scarves strewn all about her gazing fixedly at the floor andholding in her hands the old ball dress already out of fashion whichshe had worn at her first etersburg ballatasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy andseveral times that morning had tried to set to work but her heart wasnot in it and she could not and did not know how to do anything exceptwith all her heart and all her might or a while she had stood besideonya while the china was being packed and tried to help but soon gaveit up and went to her room to pack her own things t first she found itamusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids but when that wasdone and what was left had still to be packed she found it dullunyasha you pack ou will wont you dear nd when unyashawillingly promised to do it all for her atasha sat down on the floortook her old ball dress and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to whatought to have occupied her thoughts now he was roused from her reverieby the talk of the maids in the next room which was theirs and by thesound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch atasha got upand looked out of the window n enormously long row of carts full ofwounded men had stopped in the streethe housekeeper the old nurse the cooks coachmen maids footmenpostilions and scullions stood at the gate staring at the woundedatasha throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holdingan end of it in each hand went out into the streethe former housekeeper old avra uzminichna had stepped out of thecrowd by the gate gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bastmats and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside atashamoved a few steps forward and stopped shyly still holding herhandkerchief and listened to what the housekeeper was sayinghen you have nobody in oscow she was saying ou would be morecomfortable somewhere in a house in ours for instance the familyare leaving dont know if it would be allowed replied the officer in a weakvoice ere is our commanding officer ask him and he pointed to astout major who was walking back along the street past the row of cartsatasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officerand at once went to meet the majoray the wounded men stay in our house she askedhe major raised his hand to his cap with a smilehich one do you want aamselle said he screwing up his eyes andsmilingatasha quietly repeated her question and her face and whole mannerwere so serious though she was still holding the ends of herhandkerchief that the major ceased smiling and after some reflectionas if considering in how far the thing was possiblereplied in theaffirmativeh yes why not hey may he saidith a slight inclination of her head atasha stepped back quickly toavra uzminichna who stood talking compassionately to the officerhey may e says they may whispered atashahe cart in which the officer lay was turned into the ostovs yard anddozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of thetownsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of thehouses in ovarskaya treet atasha was evidently pleased to be dealingwith new people outside the ordinary routine of her life he and avrauzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into theiryardour apa must be told though said avra uzminichnaever mind never mind what does it matter or one day we can moveinto the drawing room hey can have all our half of the househere now young

doorinto the sitting room where there was a smell of vinegar and offmansdropsre you asleep ammah what sleep said the countess waking up just as she was droppinginto a dozeamma darling said atasha

answered absently hats not the point  begyou not to indulge in trifles now but to help to pack and tomorrow wemust go go gond the count gave a similar order to the majordomo and the servantst dinner etya having returned home told them the news he had heard esaid the people had been getting arms in the remlin and that thoughostopchins broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or threedays in advance the order had certainly already been given for everyoneto go armed to the hree ills tomorrow and that there would be a bigbattle therehe countess looked with timid horror at her sons eager excited faceas he said this he realized that if she said a word about his notgoing to the battle she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impendingengagement he would say something about men honor and the fatherlandsomething senseless masculine and obstinate which there would be nocontradicting and her plans would be spoiled and so hoping to arrangeto leave before then and take etya with her as their protector anddefender she did not answer him but after dinner called the countaside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly that verynight if possible ith a womans involuntary loving cunning she whotill then had not shown any alarm said that she would die of fright ifthey did not leave that very night ithout any pretense she was nowafraid of everything adame choss who had been out to visit her daughter increased thecountess fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spiritdealers in yasnitski treet hen returning by that street she hadbeen unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of theshop he had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and thecabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels atthe drink store having received orders to do softer dinner the whole ostov household set to work with enthusiastichaste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure heold count suddenly setting to work kept

obedience grew angry and nearly cried becausethey did not heed her and at last succeeded in making them believe herer first exploit which cost her immense effort and established herauthority was the packing of the carpets he count had valuableobelin tapestries and ersian carpets in the house hen atasha set towork two cases were standing open in the ballroom one almost full upwith crockery the

dissolution of formerconditions of life was but little noticeable s to the serfs the onlyindication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared duringthe night but nothing was stolen and as to the value of theirpossessions the thirty peasant carts that had come in from theirestates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable andthey were offered enormous sums of money for them ot only were hugesums offered for the horses and carts but on the previous evening andearly in the morning of the first of eptember orderlies and servantssent by wounded officers came to the ostovs and wounded men draggedthemselves there from the ostovs and from neighboring houses wherethey were accommodated entreating the servants to try to get them alift out of oscow he majordomo to

intended toadopt toward oscow n his imagination he appointed days for assembliesat the palace of the sars at which ussian notables and his own wouldmingle e mentally appointed a governor one who would win the heartsof the people aving learned that there were many charitableinstitutions in oscow he mentally decided that he would shower favorson them all e thought that as in frica he had to put on a burnooseand sit in a mosque so in oscow he must be beneficent like the sarsnd in order finally to touch the hearts of the ussiansand being likeall renchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental

that oscow was emptythat everyone had left it he faces of those who were not conferringtogether were pale and perturbed hey were not alarmed by the fact thatoscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants grave as that factseemed but by the question how to tell the mperorwithout puttinghim in the terrible position of appearing ridiculousthat he had beenawaiting the boyars so long in vain that there were drunken mobs leftin oscow but no one else ome said that a deputation of some sort mustbe scraped together others disputed that opinion and maintained thatthe mperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared and thentold the truthe will have to be told all the same said some gentlemen of thesuite ut gentlemenhe position was the more awkward because the mperor meditating uponhis magnanimous plans was pacing patiently up and down before theoutspread map occasionally glancing along the road to oscow from underhis lifted hand with a bright and proud smileut its impossible declared the gentlemen of the suite shruggingtheir shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied wordleridiculet last the mperor tired of futile expectation his actors instinctsuggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn outwas beginning to lose its sublimity gave a sign with his hand  singlereport of a signaling gun followed and the troops who were alreadyspread out on different sides of oscow moved into the city throughver aluga and orogomilov gates aster and faster vying with oneanother they moved at the double or at a trot vanishing amid theclouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roarof mingling shoutsrawn on by the movement of his troops apoleon rode with them as far asthe orogomilov gate but there again stopped and dismounting from hishorse paced for a long time by the ammerollezski rampart awaitingthe deputation eanwhile oscow was empty here were still people in it perhaps afiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained but it was emptyt was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is emptyn a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance itseems as much alive as other hiveshe bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the middaysun as gaily as around the living hives from a distance it smells ofhoney like the others and bees fly in and out in the same way ut onehas

treethere now the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us toperish o they think were dogs voices in the crowd were heard sayingmore and more frequently n the evening of the first of eptember after his interview withutuzov ount ostopchin had returned to oscow mortified and offendedbecause he had not been invited to attend the council of war andbecause utuzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in thedefense of the city amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him atthe camp which treated the tranquillity of the capital and itspatriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant andunimportant matters istressed offended and surprised by all thisostopchin had returned to oscow fter supper he lay down on a sofawithout undressing and was awakened soon after midnight by a courierbringing him a letter from utuzov his letter requested the count tosend police officers to guide the troops through the town as the armywas retreating to the yazan road beyond oscow his was not news toostopchin e had known that oscow would be abandoned not merely sincehis interview the previous day with utuzov on the oklonny ill butever since the battle of orodino for all the generals who came tooscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible tofight another battle and since then the government property had beenremoved every night and half the inhabitants had left the city withostopchins own permission et all the same this informationastonished and irritated the count coming as it did in the form of asimple note with an order from utuzov and received at night breakingin on his beauty sleephen later on in his memoirs ount ostopchin explained his actions atthis time he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two importantconsiderations to maintain tranquillity in oscow and expedite thedeparture of the inhabitants f one accepts this twofold aim allostopchins actions appear irreproachable hy were the holy relicsthe arms ammunition gunpowder and stores of corn not removed hywere thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that oscow wouldnot be given upand thereby ruined o preserve the tranquillity ofthe city explains ount ostopchin hy were bundles of uselesspapers from the government offices and eppichs balloon and otherarticles removed o leave the town empty explains ount ostopchinne need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any actionfinds a justificationll the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude forpublic tranquillityn what then was ount ostopchins fear for the tranquillity ofoscow based in  hat reason was there for assuming any probabilityof an uprising in the city he inhabitants were leaving it and theretreating troops were filling it hy should that cause the masses torioteither in oscow nor anywhere in ussia did anything resembling aninsurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town ore than tenthousand people were still in oscow on the first and second ofeptember and except for a mob in the governors courtyard assembledthere at his bidding nothing happened t is obvious that there wouldhave been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people ifafter the battle of orodino when the surrender of oscow becamecertain or at least probable ostopchin instead of exciting the peopleby distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all theholy relics the gunpowder munitions and money and had told thepopulation plainly that the town would be abandonedostopchin though he had patriotic sentiments was a sanguine andimpulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circlesand had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to beguiding ver since the enemys entry into molensk he had inimagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling ofthe heart of ussia ot only did it seem to him as to alladministrators that he controlled the external actions of oscowsinhabitants but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude bymeans of his broadsheets and posters written in a coarse tone which thepeople despise in their own class and do not understand from those inauthority ostopchin was so pleased with the fine role of leader ofpopular feeling and had grown so used to it that the necessity ofrelinquishing that role and abandoning oscow without any heroic displaytook him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from underhis feet so that he positively did not know what to do hough he knewit was coming he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believethat oscow would be abandoned and did not prepare for it heinhabitants left against his wishes f the government offices wereremoved this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the countyielded reluctantly e was absorbed in the role he had created forhimself s is often the case with those gifted with an ardentimagination though he had long known that oscow would be abandoned heknew it only with his intellect he did not believe it in his heart anddid not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairsll his painstaking and energetic activity in how far it was useful andhad any effect on the people is another question had been simplydirected toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotichatred of the renchut when events assumed their true historical character when expressinghatred for the rench in words proved insufficient when it was not evenpossible to express that hatred by fighting a battle when selfconfidence was of no avail in relation to the one question beforeoscow when the whole population streamed out of oscow as one manabandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all thedepth of their national feeling then the role chosen by ostopchinsuddenly appeared senseless e unexpectedly felt himself ridiculousweak and alone with no ground to stand onhen awakened from his sleep he received that cold peremptory notefrom utuzov he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself toblame ll that he had been specially put in charge of the stateproperty which he should have removed was still in oscow and it was nolonger possible to take the whole of it awayho is to blame for it ho has let things come to such a pass heruminated ot  of course  had everything ready  had oscowfirmly in hand nd this is what they have let it come to illainsraitors he thought without clearly defining who the villains andtraitors were but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoeverthey might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position inwhich he found himselfll that night ount ostopchin issued orders for which people came tohim from all parts of oscow hose about him had never seen

tranquillized ostopchin was not a new one ince theworld began and men have killed one another no one has ever committedsuch a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with thissame idea his idea is le bien public the hypothetical welfare ofother peopleo a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain but he whocommits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies

three more shots came from the gatene shot struck a rench soldiers foot and from behind the screenscame the strange sound of a few voices shouting nstantly as at a wordof command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of therench general officers and men changed to one of determinedconcentrated readiness for strife and suffering o all of them from themarshal to the least soldier that

he shot rattled against thestone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens and twowavering clouds of smoke rose over the quare few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stonebuilt remlin had died away the rench heard a strange sound above theirhead housands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the aircawing and noisily flapping their wings ogether with that sound came asolitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared thefigure of a bareheaded man in a peasants coat e grasped a musket andtook aim at the rench ire repeated the officer once

marching order twas a weary and famished but still a fighting and menacing army ut itremained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into theirdifferent lodgings s soon as the men of the various regiments began todisperse among the wealthy and deserted houses the army was lostforever and there came into being something nondescript neithercitizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders hen five weekslater these same men left oscow they no longer formed an army heywere a mob of marauders each carrying a quantity of articles whichseemed to him valuable or useful he aim of each man when he leftoscow was no longer as it had been to conquer but merely to keepwhat he had acquired ike a monkey which puts its paw into the narrowneck of a jug and having seized a handful of nuts will not open itsfist for fear of losing what it holds and therefore perishes therench when they left oscow had inevitably to perish because theycarried their loot with them yet to abandon what they had stolen was asimpossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let goof its nuts en minutes after each regiment had entered a oscowdistrict not a soldier or officer was left en in military uniformsand essian boots could be seen through the windows laughing andwalking through the rooms n cellars and storerooms similar men werebusy among the provisions and in the yards unlocking or breaking opencoach house and stable doors lighting fires in kitchens and kneadingand baking bread with rolledup sleeves and cooking or frighteningamusing or caressing women and children here were many such men bothin the shops and housesbut there was no armyrder after order was issued by the rench commanders that dayforbidding the men to disperse about the town sternly forbidding anyviolence to the inhabitants or any looting and announcing a roll callfor that very evening ut despite all these measures the men who hadtill then constituted an army flowed all over the wealthy desertedcity with its comforts and plentiful supplies s a hungry herd ofcattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field but gets out ofhand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches richpastures so did the army disperse all over the wealthy cityo residents were left in oscow and the soldierslike waterpercolating through sandspread irresistibly through the city in alldirections from the remlin into which they had first marched hecavalry on entering a merchants house that had been abandoned andfinding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses went onall the same to the next house which seemed to them better any ofthem appropriated several houses chalked their names on them andquarreled and even fought with other companies for them efore they hadhad time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to seethe city and hearing that everything had been abandoned rushed toplaces where valuables were to be had for the taking he officersfollowed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doingthe same n arriage ow carriages had been left in the shops andgenerals flocked there to select caleches and coaches for themselveshe few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers totheir houses hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plunderedhere were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it ll aroundthe quarters occupied by the rench were other regions still unexploredand unoccupied where they thought yet greater riches might be foundnd oscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper hen water isspilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear andmud results and in the same way the entry of the famished army into therich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destructionof both the army and the wealthy cityhe rench attributed the ire of oscow au patriotisme feroce deostopchine  the ussians to the barbarity of the rench n realityhowever it was not and could not be possible to explain the burningof oscow by making any individual or any group of people responsiblefor it oscow was burned because it found itself in a position in whichany town built of wood was bound to burn quite apart from whether ithad or had not a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines esertedoscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn onwhich sparks continually fall for several days  town built of woodwhere scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house ownersare in residence and a police force is present cannot help burning whenits inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smokepipes make campfires of the enate chairs in the enate quare andcook themselves meals twice a day n peacetime it is only necessary tobillet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires inthat district immediately increases ow much then must the probabilityof fire be increased in an abandoned wooden town where foreign troopsare quartered e patriotisme feroce de ostopchine and the barbarityof the rench were not to blame in the matter oscow was set on fire bythe soldiers pipes kitchens and campfires and by the carelessness ofenemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own ven if there was anyarson which is very doubtful for no one had any reason to burn thehousesin any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do arsoncannot be regarded as the cause for the same thing would have happenedwithout any incendiarism o ostopchins ferocious patriotismowever tempting it might be for the rench to blame ostopchinsferocity and for ussians to blame the scoundrel onaparte or later onto place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people it isimpossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of thefire for oscow had to burn as every village factory or house mustburn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed tolive and cook their porridge oscow was burned by its inhabitants itis true but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remainedin it oscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact likeerlin ienna and other towns simply because its inhabitantsabandoned it and did not welcome the rench with bread and salt norbring them the keys of the city he absorption of the rench by oscow radiating starwise as it didonly reached the quarter where ierre was staying by the evening of thesecond of eptemberfter the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstancesierre was in a state bordering on insanity e was completely obsessedby one persistent thought e did not know how or when this thought hadtaken such possession of him but he remembered nothing of the pastunderstood nothing of the present and all he saw and heard appeared tohim like a dreame had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of lifes demandsthat enmeshed him and which in his present condition he was unable tounravel e had gone to oseph lexeevichs house on the plea ofsorting the deceaseds books and papers only in search of rest fromlifes turmoil for in his mind the memory of oseph lexeevich wasconnected with a world of eternal solemn and calm thoughts quitecontrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself beingdrawn e sought a quiet refuge and in oseph lexeevichs study hereally found it hen he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing tablein the deathlike stillness of the study calm and significant memoriesof the last few days rose one after another in his imaginationparticularly of the battle of orodino and of that vague sense of hisown insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth simplicityand strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they henerasim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of takingpart in the popular defense of oscow which he knew was projected ndwith that object he had asked erasim to get him a peasants coat and apistol confiding to him his intentions of remaining in osephlexeevichs house and keeping his name secret hen during the firstday spent in inaction and solitude he tried several times to fix hisattention on the masonic manuscripts but was unable to do so the ideathat had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance ofhis name in connection with onapartes more than once vaguely presenteditself ut the idea that he russe esuhof was destined to set alimit to the power of the east was as yet only one of the fancies thatoften passed through his mind and left no trace behindhen having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part amongthe people in the defense of oscow ierre had met the ostovs andatasha had said to him re you remaining in oscow ow splendidthe thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thingeven if oscow were taken for him to remain there and do what he waspredestined to doext day with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging inany way behind them ierre went to the hree ills gate ut when hereturned to the house convinced that oscow would not be defended hesuddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibilityhad now become absolutely necessary and inevitable e must remain inoscow concealing his name and must meet apoleon and kill him andeither perish or put an end to the misery of all uropewhich it seemedto him was solely due to apoleonierre knew all the details of the attempt on onapartes life in by a erman student in ienna and knew that the student had been shotnd the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out hisdesign excited him still morewo equally strong feelings drew ierre irresistibly to this purposehe first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering inview of the common calamity the same feeling that had caused him to goto ozhaysk on the twentyfifth and to make his way to the very thick ofthe battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and inplace of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed to sleep ona hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as erasim heother was that vague and quite ussian feeling of contempt foreverything conventional artificial and humanfor everything themajority of men regard as the greatest good in the world ierre hadfirst experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the lobodaalace when he had suddenly felt that wealth power and lifeall thatmen so painstakingly acquire and guardif it has any worth has so onlyby reason of the joy with which it can all be renouncedt was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his lastpenny on drink and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for noapparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money hepossesses the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which froman ordinary point of view are insane to test as it were his personalpower and strength affirming the existence of a higher nonhumancriterion of liferom the very day ierre had experienced this feeling for the first timeat the loboda alace he had been continuously under its influence butonly now found full satisfaction for it oreover at this moment ierrewas supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what hehad already done in that direction f he were now to leave oscow likeeveryone else his flight from home the peasant coat the pistol andhis announcement to the ostovs that he would remain in oscow would allbecome not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous and tothis ierre was very sensitiveierres physical condition as is always the case corresponded to hismental state he unaccustomed coarse food the vodka he drank duringthose days the absence of wine and cigars his dirty unchanged linentwo almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without beddingallthis kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanityt was two oclock in the afternoon he rench had already enteredoscow ierre knew this but instead of acting he only thought abouthis undertaking going over its minutest details in his mind n hisfancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of theblow or the death of apoleon but with extraordinary vividness andmelancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurancees alone for the sake of all  must do it or perish he thoughtes  will approach and

the room with ierre the latter againthought it his duty to assure him that he was not rench and wished togo away but the officer would not hear of it e was so very politeamiable goodnatured and genuinely grateful to ierre for saving hislife that ierre had not the heart to refuse and sat down with him inthe parlorthe first room they entered o ierres assurances that hewas not a renchman the captain evidently not understanding how anyonecould decline so flattering an appellation shrugged his shoulders andsaid that if ierre absolutely insisted on passing for a ussian let itbe so but for all that he would be forever bound to ierre by gratitudefor saving his lifead this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving thefeelings of others and had he at all understood what ierres feelingswere the latter would probably have left him but the mans animatedobtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed ierre renchman or a ussian prince incognito said the officer

renchman looked at his guilty face and smiledo he will make his entry tomorrow he replied and continued histalkheir conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at thegate and by orel who came to say that some urttemberg hussars hadcome and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captainshorses were his difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars didnot understand what was said to them in renchhe captain had their senior sergeant called in and in a stern voiceasked him to what regiment he belonged who was his commanding officerand by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were alreadyoccupied he erman who knew little rench answered the two firstquestions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commandingofficer but in reply to the third question which he did not understandsaid introducing broken rench into his own erman that he was thequartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him tooccupy all the houses one after another ierre who knew ermantranslated what the erman said to the captain and gave the captainsreply to the urttemberg hussar in erman hen he had understood whatwas said to him the erman submitted and took his men elsewhere hecaptain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voicehen he returned to the room ierre was sitting in the same place asbefore with his head in his hands is face expressed suffering ereally was suffering at that moment hen the captain went out and hewas left alone suddenly he came to himself and realized the position hewas in t was not that oscow had been taken or that the happyconquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him ainful as thatwas it was not that which tormented ierre at the moment e wastormented by the consciousness of his own weakness he few glasses ofwine he had drunk and the conversation with this goodnatured man haddestroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the lastfew days and which was essential for the execution of his design hepistol dagger and peasant coat were ready apoleon was to enter thetown next day ierre still considered that it would be a useful andworthy action to slay the evildoer but now he felt that he would not doit e did not know why but he felt a foreboding that he would notcarry out his intention e struggled against the confession of hisweakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that hisformer gloomy frame of mind concerning vengeance killing and selfsacrifice had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man hemethe captain returned to the room limping slightly and whistling a tunehe renchmans chatter which had previously amused ierre now repelledhim he tune he was whistling his gait and the gesture with which hetwirled his mustache all now seemed offensive  will go awayimmediately  wont say another word to him thought ierre ethought this but still sat in the same place  strange feeling ofweakness tied him to the spot he wished to get up and go away butcould not do sohe captain on the other hand seemed very cheerful e paced up anddown the room twice is eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if hewere smiling to himself at some amusing thoughthe colonel of those urttembergers is delightful he suddenly saides a erman but a nice fellow all the same ut hes a ermane sat down facing ierre y the way you know

himonestly without speaking of what  owe you  feel friendship foryou an  do anything for you ispose of me t is for life and death say it with my hand on my heart said he striking his chesthank you

fillingtwo glasses with wineierre took one of the glasses and emptied it amballe emptied his tooagain pressed ierres hand and leaned his elbows on the table in apensive attitudees my dear friend he began such is fortunes caprice ho wouldhave said that  should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in theservice of onaparte as we used to call him et here  am in oscowwith him  must tell you mon cher he continued in the sad andmeasured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story that our nameis one of the most ancient in rancend with a renchmans easy and naive frankness the captain told ierrethe story of his ancestors his childhood youth and manhood and allabout his relations and his financial and family affairs ma pauvremere playing of course an important part in the storyut all that is only lifes setting the real thing is lovelove m not right onsieur ierre said he growing animated nother glassierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a thirdh women women and the captain looking with glistening eyes atierre began talking of love and of his love affairshere were very many of these as one could easily believe looking atthe officers handsome selfsatisfied face and noting the eagerenthusiasm with which he spoke of women hough all amballes lovestories had the sensual character which renchmen regard as the specialcharm and poetry of love yet he told his story with such sincereconviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of loveand he described women so alluringly that ierre listened to him withcuriosityt was plain that lamour which the renchman was so fond of was notthat low and simple kind that ierre had once felt for his wife nor wasit the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced foratasha amballe despised both these kinds of love equally the one heconsidered the love of clodhoppers and the other the love ofsimpletons amour which the renchman worshiped consistedprincipally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in acombination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feelinghus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for afascinating marquise of thirtyfive and at the same time for a charminginnocent child of seventeen daughter of the bewitching marquise heconflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter ending inthe mothers sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriageto her lover even now agitated the captain though it was the memory ofa distant past hen he recounted an episode in which the husband playedthe part of the lover and hethe loverassumed the role of thehusband as well as several droll incidents from his recollections ofermany where shelter is called nterkunft and where the husbands eatsauerkraut and the young girls are too blondeinally the latest episode in oland still fresh in the captainsmemory and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face wasof how he had saved the life of a ole in general the saving of lifecontinually occurred in the captains stories and the ole hadentrusted to him his enchanting wife parisienne de coeur while himselfentering the rench service he captain was happy the enchantingolish lady wished to elope with him but prompted by magnanimity thecaptain restored the wife to the husband saying as he did so  havesaved your life and  save your honor aving repeated these words thecaptain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake as if driving away theweakness which assailed him at this touching recollectionistening to the captains tales ierreas often happens late in theevening and under the influence of winefollowed all that was told himunderstood it all and at the same time followed a train of personalmemories which he knew not why suddenly arose in his mind hilelistening to these love stories his own love for atasha unexpectedlyrose to his mind and going over the pictures of that love in hisimagination he mentally compared them with amballes tales isteningto the story of the struggle between love and duty ierre saw beforehis eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object ofhis love at the ukharev water tower t the time of that meeting it hadnot produced an effect upon himhe had not even once recalled it utnow it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something veryimportant and poeticeter irilovich come here e have recognized you he now seemed tohear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes hersmile her traveling hood and a stray lock of her hair and thereseemed to him something pathetic and touching in all thisaving finished his tale about the enchanting olish lady the captainasked ierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrificehimself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husbandhallenged by this question ierre raised his head and felt a need toexpress the thoughts that filled his mind e began to explain that heunderstood love for a women somewhat differently e said that in allhis life he had loved and still loved only one woman and that she couldnever be hisiens said the captainierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliestyears but that he had not dared to think of her because she was tooyoung and because he had been an illegitimate son without a namefterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think ofher because he loved her too well placing her far above everything inthe world and especially therefore above himselfhen he had reached this point ierre asked the captain whether heunderstood thathe captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understandit he begged ierre to continuelatonic love clouds he mutteredhether it was the wine he had drunk or an impulse of frankness or thethought that this man did not and never would know any of those whoplayed a part in his story or whether it was all these things togethersomething loosened ierres tongue peaking thickly and with a farawaylook in his shining eyes he told the whole story of his life hismarriage atashas love for his best friend her betrayal of him andall his own simple relations with her rged on by amballes questionshe also told what he had at first concealedhis own position and evenhis nameore than anything else in ierres story the captain was impressed bythe fact that ierre was very rich had two mansions in oscow and thathe had abandoned everything and not left the city but remained thereconcealing his name and stationhen it was late at night they went out together into the street henight was warm and light o the left of the house on the okrovka afire glowedthe first of those that were beginning in oscow o theright and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon andopposite to it

that something heavy was beating rhythmically againstall the walls of the room it was her own heart sinking with alarm andterror and overflowing with lovehe opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the colddamp earthen floor of the passage he cold she felt refreshed her ithher bare feet she touched a sleeping man stepped over him and openedthe door into the part of the hut where rince ndrew lay t was darkin there n the farthest corner on a bench beside a bed on whichsomething was lying stood a tallow candle with a long thick andsmoldering wickrom the moment she had been told that morning of rince ndrews woundand his presence there atasha had resolved to see him he did notknow why she had to she knew the meeting would be painful but felt themore convinced that it was necessaryll day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night ut nowthat the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she mightsee ow was he maimed hat was left of him as he like that incessantmoaning of the adjutants es he was altogether like that n herimagination he was that terrible moaning personified hen she saw anindistinct shape in the corner and mistook his knees raised under thequilt for his shoulders she imagined a horrible body there and stoodstill in terror ut an irresistible impulse drew her forward hecautiously took one step and then another and found herself in themiddle of a small room containing baggage nother manimokhinwaslying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons and two othersthedoctor and a valetlay on the floorhe valet sat up and whispered something imokhin kept awake by thepain in his wounded leg gazed with wideopen eyes at this strangeapparition of a girl in a white chemise dressing jacket and nightcaphe valets sleepy frightened exclamation hat do you want hatsthe matter made atasha approach more swiftly to what was lying in thecorner orribly unlike a man as that body looked she must see him hepassed the valet the snuff fell from the candle wick and she sawrince ndrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt and such as shehad always seen hime was the same as ever but the feverish color of his face hisglittering eyes rapturously turned toward her and especially his neckdelicate as a childs revealed by the turndown collar of his shirtgave him a peculiarly innocent childlike look such as she had neverseen on him before he went up to him and with a swift flexibleyouthful movement dropped on her kneese smiled and held out his hand to her even days had passed since rince ndrew found himself in the ambulancestation on the field of orodino is feverish state and theinflammation of his bowels which were injured were in the doctorsopinion sure to carry him off ut on the seventh day he ate withpleasure a piece of bread with some tea and the doctor noticed that histemperature was lower e had regained consciousness that morning hefirst night after they left oscow had been fairly warm and he hadremained in the caleche but at ytishchi the wounded man himself askedto be taken out and given some tea he pain caused by his removal intothe hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness hen hehad been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless withclosed eyes hen he opened them and whispered softly nd the teais remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished thedoctor e felt rince ndrews pulse and to his surprise anddissatisfaction found it had improved e was dissatisfied because heknew by experience that if his patient did not die now he would do so alittle later with greater suffering imokhin the rednosed major ofrince ndrews regiment had joined him in oscow and was being takenalong with him having been wounded in the leg at the battle oforodino hey were accompanied by a doctor rince ndrews valet hiscoachman and two orderlieshey gave rince ndrew some tea e drank it eagerly looking withfeverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand andremember something dont want any more s imokhin here he askedimokhin crept along the bench to him am here your excellencyows your woundine sir ll right ut how about yourince ndrew again pondered as if trying to remember somethingouldnt one get a book he askedhat bookhe ospels  havent onehe doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he wasfeeling rince ndrew answered all his questions reluctantly butreasonably and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he wasuncomfortable and in great pain he doctor and valet lifted the cloakwith which he was covered and making wry faces at the noisome smell ofmortifying flesh that came from the wound began examining that dreadfulplace he doctor was very much displeased about something and made achange in the dressings turning the wounded man over so that he groanedagain and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony e kept askingthem to get him the book and put it under himhat trouble would it be to you he said  have not got one leaseget it for me and put it under for a moment he pleaded in a piteousvoicehe doctor went into the passage to wash his handsou fellows have no conscience said he to the valet who was pouringwater over his hands or just one moment  didnt look after youts such pain you know that  wonder how he can bear ity the ord esus hrist  thought we had put something under himsaid the valethe first time rince ndrew understood where he was and what was thematter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he askedto be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at ytishchifter growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut heagain regained consciousness and while drinking tea once more recalledall that had happened to him and above all vividly remembered themoment at the ambulance station when at the sight of the sufferings ofa man he disliked those new thoughts had come to him which promised himhappiness nd those thoughts though now vague and indefinite againpossessed his soul e remembered that he had now a new source ofhappiness and that this happiness had something to do with the ospelshat was why he asked for a copy of them he uncomfortable position inwhich they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughtsand when he came to himself a third time it was in the completestillness of the night verybody near him was sleeping  cricketchirped from across the passage someone was shouting and singing in thestreet cockroaches rustled on the table on the icons and on thewalls and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around thecandle beside him the wick of which was charred and had shaped itselflike a mushroomis mind was not in a normal state  healthy man usually thinks offeels and remembers innumerable things simultaneously but has thepower and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which tofix his whole attention  healthy man can tear himself away from thedeepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and canthen return again to his own thoughts ut rince ndrews mind was notin a normal state in that respect ll the powers of his mind were moreactive and clearer than ever but they acted apart from his will ostdiverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously t times hisbrain suddenly began to work with a vigor clearness and depth it hadnever reached when he was in health but suddenly in the midst of itswork it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strengthto turn it back againes a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot bedeprived he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hutgazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes  happinesslying beyond material forces outside the material influences that acton mana happiness of the soul alone the happiness of loving veryman can understand it but to conceive it and enjoin it was possibleonly for od ut how did od enjoin that law nd why was the onnd suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off and rince ndrewheard without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality a softwhispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating pitipitipiti and then titi and then again pitipitipiti and titionce more t the same time he felt that above his face above the verymiddle of it some strange airy structure was being erected out ofslender needles or splinters to the sound of this whispered music efelt that he had to balance carefully though it was difficult so thatthis airy structure should not collapse but nevertheless it keptcollapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmicmusicit stretches stretches spreading out and stretching saidrince ndrew to himself hile listening to this whispering and feelingthe sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edificeof needles he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle andheard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly thatflopped against his pillow and his face ach time the fly touched hisface it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did notdestroy the structure though it knocked against the very region of hisface where it was rising ut besides this there was something else ofimportance t was something white by the doorthe statue of a sphinxwhich also oppressed himut perhaps thats my shirt on the table he thought and thats mylegs and that is the door but why is it always stretching and drawingitself out and pitipitipiti and titi and pitipitipitihats enough please leave off rince ndrew painfully entreatedsomeone nd suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface ofhis mind with peculiar clearness and forceeslove he thought again quite clearly ut not love which lovesfor something for some quality for some purpose or for some reasonbut the love which while dyingfirst experienced when  saw my enemyand yet loved him  experienced that feeling of love which is the veryessence of the soul and does not require an object ow again  feelthat bliss o love ones neighbors to love ones enemies to loveeverything to love od in all is manifestations t is possible tolove someone dear to you with human love but an enemy can only be lovedby divine love hat is why  experienced such joy when  felt that loved that man hat has become of him s he alivehen loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred butdivine love cannot change o neither death nor anything else candestroy it t is the very essence of the soul et how many people have hated in my life nd of them all  loved and hated none as  didher nd he vividly pictured to himself atasha not as he had done inthe past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight but for thefirst time picturing to himself her soul nd he understood herfeelings her sufferings shame and remorse e now understood for thefirst time all the cruelty of his rejection of her the cruelty of hisrupture with her f only it were possible for me to see her once moreust once looking into those eyes to sayitipitipiti and titi and pitipitipiti boom flopped the flynd his attention was suddenly carried into another world a world ofreality and delirium in which something particular was happening nthat world some structure was still being erected and did not fallsomething was still stretching out and the candle with its red halo wasstill burning and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door butbesides all this something creaked there was a whiff of fresh air anda new white sphinx appeared standing at the door nd that sphinx hadthe pale face and shining eyes of the very atasha of whom he had justbeen thinkingh how oppressive this continual delirium is thought rince ndrewtrying to drive that face from his imagination ut the face remainedbefore him with the force of reality and drew nearer rince ndrewwished to return to that former world of pure thought but he could notand delirium drew him back into its domain he soft whispering voicecontinued its rhythmic murmur something oppressed him and stretchedout and the strange face was before him rince ndrew collected allhis strength in an effort to recover his senses he moved a little andsuddenly there was a ringing in his ears a dimness in his eyes andlike a man plunged into water he lost consciousness hen he came tohimself atasha that same living atasha whom of all people he mostlonged to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed tohim was kneeling before him e realized that it was the real livingatasha and he was not surprised but quietly happy atasha motionlesson her knees she was unable to stir with frightened eyes riveted onhim was restraining her sobs er face was pale and rigid nly in thelower part of it something quiveredrince ndrew sighed with relief smiled and held out his handou he said ow fortunateith a rapid but careful movement atasha drew nearer to him on herknees and taking his hand carefully bent her face over it and begankissing it just touching it lightly with her lipsorgive me she whispered raising her head and glancing at himorgive me love you said rince ndreworgiveorgive what he askedorgive me for what  have done faltered atasha in a scarcelyaudible broken whisper and began kissing his hand more rapidly justtouching it with her lips love you more better than before said rince ndrew lifting herface with his hand so as to look into her eyeshose eyes filled with happy tears gazed at him timidlycompassionately and with joyous love atashas thin pale face withits swollen lips was more than plainit was dreadful ut rincendrew did not see that he saw her shining eyes which were beautifulhey heard the sound of voices behind themeter the valet who was now wide awake had roused the doctorimokhin who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg hadlong been watching all that was going on carefully covering his barebody with the sheet as he huddled up on his benchhats this said the doctor rising from his bed lease go awaymadamt that moment a maid sent by the countess who had noticed herdaughters absence knocked at the doorike a somnambulist aroused from her sleep atasha went out of the roomand returning to her hut fell sobbing on her bedrom that time during all the rest of the ostovs journey at everyhalting place and wherever they spent a night atasha never left thewounded olkonski and the doctor had to admit that he had not expectedfrom a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing awounded manreadful as the countess imagined it would be should rince ndrew diein her daughters arms during the journeyas judging by what thedoctor said it seemed might easily happenshe could not opposeatasha hough with the intimacy now established between the woundedman and atasha the thought occurred that should he recover their formerengagement would be renewed no oneleast of all atasha and rincendrewspoke of this the unsettled question of life and death whichhung not only over olkonski but over all ussia shut out all otherconsiderations n the third of eptember ierre awoke late is head was aching theclothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable onhis body and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful hehad done the day before hat something shameful was his yesterdaysconversation with aptain amballet was eleven by the clock but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doorsierre rose rubbed his eyes and seeing the pistol with an engravedstock which erasim had replaced on the writing table he rememberedwhere he was and what lay before him that very daym  not too late he thought o probably he wont make his entryinto oscow before noonierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him buthastened to actfter arranging his clothes he took the pistol and was about to go outut it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly couldnot carry the weapon in his hand through the streets t was difficultto hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat e could not carryit unnoticed in his belt or under his arm esides it had beendischarged and he had not had time to reload it o matter daggerwill do he said to himself though when planning his design he hadmore than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by thestudent in  had been to try to kill apoleon with a dagger ut ashis chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design but in provingto himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all hecould to achieve it ierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in agreen sheath which he had bought at the ukharev market with the pistoland hid it under his waistcoataving tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his headierre went down the corridor trying to avoid making a noise or meetingthe captain and passed out into the streethe conflagration at which he had looked with so much indifference theevening before had greatly increased during the night oscow was onfire in several places he buildings in arriage ow across the riverin the azaar and the ovarskoy as well as the barges on the oskvaiver and the timber yards by the orogomilov ridge were all ablazeierres way led through side streets to the ovarskoy and from there tothe church of t icholas on the rbat where he had long beforedecided that the deed should be done he gates of most of the houseswere locked and the shutters up he streets and lanes were desertedhe air was full of smoke and the smell of burning ow and then he metussians with anxious and timid faces and renchmen with an air not ofthe city but of the camp walking in the middle of the streets oth theussians and the rench looked at ierre with surprise esides hisheight and stoutness and the strange morose look of suffering in hisface and whole figure the ussians stared at ierre because they couldnot make out to what class he could belong he rench followed him withastonishment in their eyes chiefly because ierre unlike all the otherussians who gazed at the rench with fear and curiosity paid noattention to them t the gate of one house three renchmen who wereexplaining something to some ussians who did not understand themstopped ierre asking if he did not know renchierre shook his head and went on n another side street a sentinelstanding beside a green caisson shouted at him but only when the shoutwas threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the mans musket ashe raised it did ierre understand that he had to pass on the other sideof the street e heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on aroundhim e carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste likesomething dreadful and alien to him for after the previous nightsexperience he was afraid of losing it ut he was not destined to bringhis mood safely to his destination nd even had he not been hindered byanything on the way his intention could not now have been carried outfor apoleon had passed the rbat more than four hours previously on hisway from the orogomilov suburb to the remlin and was now sitting in avery gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the remlin givingdetailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately toextinguish the fire to prevent looting and to reassure theinhabitants ut ierre did not know this he was entirely absorbed inwhat lay before him and was torturedas those are who obstinatelyundertake a task that is impossible for them not because of itsdifficulty but because of its incompatibility with their naturesby thefear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his selfesteemhough he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinctand did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the ovarskoys ierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denserheeven felt the heat of the fire ccasionally curly tongues of flame rosefrom under the roofs of the houses e met more people in the streetsand they were more excited ut ierre though he felt that somethingunusual was happening around him did not realize that he wasapproaching the fire s he was going along a foot path across a wideopen space adjoining the ovarskoy on one side and the gardens of rinceruzinskis house on the other ierre suddenly heard the desperateweeping of a woman close to him e stopped as if awakening from a dreamand lifted his heady the side of the path on the dusty dry grass all sorts of householdgoods lay in a heap featherbeds a samovar icons and trunks n theground beside the trunks sat a thin woman no longer

steps hefollowed the maid overtook her and came out on the ovarskoy hewhole street was full of clouds of black smoke ongues of flame hereand there broke through that cloud  great number of people crowded infront of the conflagration n the middle of the street stood a renchgeneral saying something to those around him ierre accompanied by themaid was advancing to the spot where the general stood but the renchsoldiers stopped himn ne passe pas  cried a voice ou cant passhis way uncle cried the girl ell pass through the side streetby the ikulinsierre turned back giving a spring now and then to keep up with herhe ran across the street turned down a side street to the left andpassing three houses turned into a yard on the rightts here close by said she and running across the yard opened agate in a wooden fence and stopping pointed out to him a small woodenwing of the house which was burning brightly and fiercely ne of itssides had fallen in another was on fire and bright flames issued fromthe openings of the windows and from under the roofs ierre passed through the fence gate he was enveloped by hot air andinvoluntarily stoppedhich is it hich is your house he askedoh wailed the

expression to her feelingsierre rushed to the wing but the heat was so great that heinvoluntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house thatwas as yet burning only at one end just below the roof and aroundwhich swarmed a crowd of renchmen t first ierre did not realize whatthese men who were dragging something out were about but seeingbefore him a renchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and tryingto take from him a foxfur coat he vaguely understood that looting wasgoing on there but he had no time to dwell on that ideahe sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings thewhistle and hiss of the flames the excited shouts of the people andthe sight of the swaying smoke now gathering into thick black cloudsand now soaring up with glittering sparks with here and there densesheaves of flame now red and now like golden fish scales creeping alongthe walls and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion produced onierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration t had apeculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felthimself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down e feltyoung bright adroit and resolute e ran round to the other side ofthe lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was stillstanding when just above his head he heard several voices shouting andthen a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling closebeside himierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some renchmenwho had just thrown out the drawer of a chest filled with metalarticles ther rench soldiers standing below went up to the drawerhat does this fellow want shouted one of them referring to ierreheres a child in that house avent you seen a child cried ierrehats he talking about et along said several voices and one ofthe soldiers evidently afraid that ierre might want to take from themsome of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer movedthreateningly toward him child

shouted the renchman at the window pointing to thegarden at the back of the house ait a bitm coming downnd a minute or two later the renchman a blackeyed fellow with a spoton his cheek in shirt sleeves really did jump out of a window on theground floor and clapping ierre on the shoulder ran with him into thegardenurry up you others he called out to his comrades ts gettinghothen they reached a gravel path behind the house the renchman pulledierre by the arm and pointed to a round graveled space where a threeyearold girl in a pink dress was lying under a seathere is your child h a girl so much the better said therenchman oodbye atty e must be human we are all mortal youknow and the renchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to hiscomradesreathless with joy ierre ran to the little girl and was going to takeher in his arms ut seeing a stranger the sickly scrofulouslookingchild unattractively like her mother began to yell and run awayierre however seized her and lifted her in his arms he screameddesperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull ierreshands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth ierre was seizedby a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced whentouching some nasty little animal ut he made an effort not to throwthe child down and ran with her to the large house t was now howeverimpossible to get back the way he had come the maid niska was nolonger there and ierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed thewet painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ranwith her through the garden seeking another way out aving run through different yards and side streets ierre got backwith his little burden to the ruzinski garden at the corner of theovarskoy e did not at first recognize the place from which he had setout to look for the child so crowded was it now with people and goodsthat had been dragged out of the houses esides ussian families whohad taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings there wereseveral rench soldiers in a variety of clothing ierre took no noticeof them e hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order torestore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else ierrefelt that he had still much to do and to do quickly lowing with theheat and from running he felt at that moment more strongly than everthe sense of youth animation and determination that had come on himwhen he ran to save the child he had now become quiet and clingingwith her little hands to ierres coat sat on his arm gazing about herlike some little wild animal e glanced at her occasionally with aslight smile e fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in thatfrightened sickly little facee did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them ewalked among the crowd with rapid steps scanning the various faces hemet nvoluntarily he noticed a eorgian or rmenian family consistingof a very handsome old man of riental type wearing a new clothcovered sheepskin coat and new boots an old woman of similar type anda young woman hat very young woman seemed to ierre the perfection ofriental beauty with her sharply outlined arched black eyebrows andthe extraordinarily soft bright color of her long beautifulexpressionless face mid the scattered property and the crowd on theopen space she in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac

almondshapedeyes at the ground before her vidently she was aware of her beauty andfearful because of it er face struck ierre and hurrying along by thefence he turned several times to look at her hen he had reached thefence still without finding those he sought he stopped and lookedabout himith the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous thanbefore and a group of ussians both men and women gathered about himave you lost anyone my dear fellow oure of the gentry yourselfarent you hose child is it they asked himierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat whohad

appeared from round the corner he uhlans came up at a trot toierre and the renchman and surrounded them ierre remembered nothingof what happened after that e only remembered beating someone andbeing

far as she personallywas concerned she would be the last to quit etersburgt nna avlovnas on the twentysixth of ugust the very day of thebattle of orodino there was a soiree the chief feature of which wasto be the reading of a letter from is ordship the ishop when sendingthe mperor an icon of the enerable ergius t was regarded as a modelof ecclesiastical patriotic eloquence rince asili himself famed forhis elocution was to read it e used to read at the mpress heart of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words quiteindependently of their meaning in a loud and singsong voice alternatingbetween a despairing wail and a tender murmur so that the wail fellquite at random on one word and the murmur on another his reading aswas always the case at nna avlovnas soirees had a politicalsignificance hat evening she expected several important personages whohad to be made ashamed of their visits to the rench theater and arousedto a patriotic temper  good many people had already arrived but nnaavlovna not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing roomdid not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a generalconversationhe news of the day in etersburg was the illness of ountess ezukhovahe had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously had missedseveral gatherings of which she was usually ornament and was said to bereceiving no one and instead of the celebrated etersburg doctors whousually attended her had entrusted herself to some talian doctor whowas treating her in some new and unusual wayhey all knew very well that the enchanting countess illness arose froman inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same timeand that the talians cure consisted in removing such inconveniencebut in nna avlovnas presence no one dared to think of this or evenappear to know ithey say the poor countess is very ill he doctor says it is anginapectorisngina h thats a terrible illnesshey say that the rivals are reconciled thanks to the angina andthe word angina was repeated with great satisfactionhe count is pathetic they say e cried like a child when the doctortold him the case was dangeroush it would be a terrible loss she is an enchanting womanou are speaking of the poor countess said nna avlovna coming upjust then  sent to ask for news and hear that she is a littlebetter h she is certainly the most charming woman in the world shewent on with a smile at her own enthusiasm e belong to differentcamps but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves heis very unfortunate added nna avlovnaupposing that by these words nna avlovna was somewhat lifting theveil from the secret of the countess malady an unwary young manventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been calledin and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who mightemploy dangerous remediesour information may be better than mine nna avlovna suddenly andvenomously retorted on the inexperienced young man but  know on goodauthority that this doctor is a very learned and able man e is privatephysician to the ueen of painnd having thus demolished the young man nna avlovna turned toanother group where ilibin was talking about the ustrians havingwrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out againand utter one of his mots think it is delightful he said

theyll know how to arrange matters nd really during theawkward silence that ensued that insufficiently patriotic personentered whom nna avlovna had been waiting for and wished to convertand she

to him on the occasion of his daughters death said ofutuzov whom he had formerly praised it was excusable for him in hisgrief to forget what he had said that it was impossible to expectanything else from a blind and depraved old man only wonder that the fate of ussia could have been entrusted to sucha mans long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt itbut the next day the following communication was received from ountostopchinrince utuzovs adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demandspolice officers to guide the army to the yazan road e writes that heis regretfully abandoning oscow ire utuzovs action decides thefate of the capital and of your empire ussia will shudder to learn ofthe abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and

showninto the mperors study that the latter at once askedave you brought me sad news olonelery sad sire replied ichaud lowering his eyes with a sigh heabandonment of oscowave they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle asked themperor quickly his face suddenly flushingichaud respectfully delivered the message utuzov had entrusted to himwhich was that it had been impossible to fight before oscow and thatas the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well asoscow or losing oscow alone the field marshal had to choose thelatterhe mperor listened in silence not looking at ichaudas the enemy entered the city he askedes sire and oscow is now in ashes  left it all in flamesreplied ichaud in a decided tone but glancing at the mperor he wasfrightened by what he had donehe mperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly his lower liptrembled and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyesut this lasted only a moment e suddenly frowned as if blaminghimself for his weakness and raising his head addressed ichaud in afirm voice see olonel from all that is happening that rovidence requiresgreat sacrifices of us  am ready to submit myself in all things tois will but

mperortouching his breast e can no longer both reign together  havelearned to know him and he will not deceive me any morend the mperor paused with a frownhen he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution inthe mperors eyes ichaudquoique etranger russe de coeur et dameat that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heardas he used afterwards to say and gave expression to his own feelingsand those of the ussian people whose representative he consideredhimself to be in the following wordsire said he our ajesty is at this moment signing the glory ofthe nation and the salvation of uropeith an inclination of the head the mperor dismissed him t is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine thatwhen half ussia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing todistant provinces and one levy after another was being raised for thedefense of the fatherland all ussians from the greatest to the leastwere solely engaged in sacrificing themselves saving their fatherlandor weeping over its downfall he tales and descriptions of that timewithout exception speak only of the selfsacrifice patriotic devotiondespair grief and the heroism of the ussians ut it was not reallyso t appears so to us because we see only the general historicinterest of that time and do not see all the personal human intereststhat people had et in reality those personal interests of the momentso much transcend the general interests that they always prevent thepublic interest from being felt or even noticed ost of the people atthat time paid no attention to the general progress of events but wereguided only by their private interests and they were the very peoplewhose activities at that period were most usefulhose who tried to understand the general course of events and to takepart in it by selfsacrifice and heroism were the most useless membersof society they saw everything upside down and all they did for thecommon good turned out to be useless and foolishlike ierres andamonovs regiments which looted ussian villages and the lint theyoung ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded and so onven those fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelingswho discussed ussias position at the time involuntarily introducedinto their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood oruseless condemnation and anger directed against people accused ofactions no one could possibly be guilty of n historic events the ruleforbidding us to eat of the fruit of the ree of nowledge is speciallyapplicable nly unconscious action bears fruit and he who plays a partin an historic event never understands its significance f he tries torealize it his efforts are fruitlesshe more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place inussia the less did he realize their significance n etersburg and inthe provinces at a distance from oscow ladies and gentlemen inmilitia uniforms wept for ussia and its ancient capital and talked ofselfsacrifice and so on but in the army which retired beyond oscowthere was little talk or thought of oscow and when they caught sightof its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the rench but theythought about their next pay their next quarters of atreshka thevivandiere and like matterss the war had caught him in the service icholas ostov took a closeand prolonged part in the defense of his country but did so casuallywithout any aim at selfsacrifice and he therefore looked at what wasgoing on in ussia without despair and without dismally racking hisbrains over it ad he been asked what he thought of the state ofussia he would have said that it was not his business to think aboutit that utuzov and others were there for that purpose but that he hadheard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength thatfighting would probably go on for a long time yet and that things beingso it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a coupleof years times he looked at the matter in this way he learned that he was beingsent to oronezh to buy remounts for his division not only withoutregret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle butwith the greatest pleasurewhich he did not conceal and which hiscomrades fully understood few days before the battle of orodino icholas received thenecessary money and warrants and having sent some hussars on inadvance he set out with post horses for oronezhnly a man who has experienced itthat is has passed some monthscontinuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and warcan understand thedelight icholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by thearmys foraging operations provision trains and hospitals henfreefrom soldiers wagons and the filthy traces of a camphe saw villageswith peasants and peasant women gentlemens country houses fieldswhere cattle were grazing posthouses with stationmasters asleep inthem he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time hat fora long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women youngand healthy without a dozen officers making up to each of them womentoo who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should jokewith themn the highest spirits icholas arrived at night at a hotel in oronezhordered things he had long been deprived of in camp and next day verycleanshaven and in a fulldress uniform he had not worn for a longtime went to present himself to the authoritieshe commander of the militia was a civilian general an old man who wasevidently pleased with his military designation and rank e receivedicholas brusquely imagining this to be characteristically militaryand questioned him with an important air as if considering the generalprogress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to doso icholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused himrom the commander of the militia he drove to the governor he governorwas a brisk little man very simple and affable e indicated the studfarms at which icholas might procure horses recommended to him a horsedealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who hadthe best horses and promised to assist him in every wayou are ount lya ostovs son y wife was a great friend of yourmothers e are at home on hursdaystoday is hursday so please comeand see us quite informally said the governor taking leave of himmmediately on leaving the governors icholas hired post horses andtaking his squadron quartermaster with him drove at a gallop to thelandowner fourteen miles away who had the stud verything seemed tohim pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in oronezhand as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mindeverything went well and easilyhe landowner to whom icholas went was a bachelor an old cavalryman ahorse fancier a sportsman the possessor of some centuryold brandy andsome old ungarian wine who had a snuggery where he smoked and whoowned some splendid horsesn very few words icholas bought seventeen picked stallions for sixthousand rublesto serve as he said as samples of his remounts fterdining and taking rather too much of the ungarian wine icholashaving exchanged kisses with the landowner with whom he was already onthe friendliest termsgalloped back over abominable roads in thebrightest frame of mind continually urging on the driver so as to be intime for the governors partyhen he had changed poured water over his head and scented himselficholas arrived at the governors rather late but with the phrasebetter late than never on his lipst was not a ball nor had dancing been announced but everyone knewthat atherine etrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on theclavichord and that there would be dancing and so everyone had come asto a ballrovincial life in  went on very much as usual but with thisdifference that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of thearrival of many wealthy families from oscow and as in everything thatwent on in ussia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable anin for a penny in for a poundwho cares spirit and the inevitablesmall talk instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintancesnow turned on oscow the army and apoleonhe society gathered together at the governors was the best inoronezhhere were a great many ladies and some of icholas oscowacquaintances but there were no men who could at all vie with thecavalier of t eorge the hussar remount officer the goodnatured andwellbred ount ostov mong the men was an talian prisoner anofficer of the rench army and icholas felt that the presence of thatprisoner enhanced his own importance as a ussian hero he talian wasas it were a war trophy icholas felt this it seemed to him thateveryone regarded the talian in the same light and he treated himcordially though with dignity and restraints soon as icholas entered in his hussar uniform diffusing around hima fragrance of perfume and wine and had uttered the words better latethan never and heard them repeated several times by others peopleclustered around him all eyes turned on him and he felt at once thathe had entered into his proper position in the provincethat of auniversal favorite a very pleasant position and intoxicatingly soafter his long privations t posting stations at inns and in thelandowners snuggery maidservants had been flattered by his notice andhere too at the governors party there were as it seemed to icholasan inexhaustible number of pretty young women married and unmarriedimpatiently awaiting his notice he women and girls flirted with himand from the first day the people concerned themselves to get thisfine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down mong thesewas the governors wife herself who welcomed ostov as a near relativeand called him icholasatherine etrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise anddancing began in which icholas still further captivated the provincialsociety by his agility is particularly free manner of dancing evensurprised them all icholas was himself rather surprised at the way hedanced that evening e had never danced like that in oscow and wouldeven have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and inbad form but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all bysomething unusual something they would have to accept as the regularthing in the capital though new to them in the provincesll the evening icholas paid attention to a blueeyed plump andpleasing little blonde the wife of one of the provincial officialsith the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other menswives were created for them ostov did not leave the ladys side andtreated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style as ifwithout speaking of it they knew how capitally icholas and the ladywould get on together he husband however did not seem to share thatconviction and tried to behave morosely with ostov ut the lattersgoodnatured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even heinvoluntarily yielded to icholas good humor oward the end of theevening however as the wifes face grew more flushed and animated thehusbands became more and more melancholy and solemn as though therewere but a given amount of animation between them and as the wifesshare increased the husbands diminished icholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair bending closelyover the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with asmile that never left his face auntily shifting the position of hislegs in their tight riding breeches diffusing an odor of perfume andadmiring his partner himself and the fine outlines of his legs intheir wellfitting essian boots icholas told the blonde lady that hewished to run away with a certain lady here in oronezhhich lady charming lady a divine one er eyes icholas looked at hispartner are blue her mouth coral and ivory her figure he glancedat her shoulders like ianashe husband came up and sullenly

was almost a stranger hen he afterwardsrecalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness whichhad very important results for him it seemed to himas it seems toeveryone in such casesthat it was merely some silly whim that seizedhim yet that burst of frankness together with other trifling eventshad immense consequences for him and for all his familyou see unt amma has long wanted me to

ussia he was agitated andincessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brotherthe only intimate person now remaining to her was exposed he wasworried too about her nephews education for which she had always feltherself incompetent but in the depths of her soul she felt at peaceapeace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreamsand hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and wererelated to her meeting with ostovhe day after her party the governors wife came to see alvintseva andafter discussing her plan with the aunt remarked that though underpresent circumstances a formal betrothal was of course not to bethought of all the same the young people might be brought together andcould get to know one another alvintseva expressed approval and thegovernors wife began to speak of ostov in arys presence praisinghim and telling how he had blushed when rincess arys name wasmentioned ut rincess ary experienced a painful rather than a joyfulfeelingher mental tranquillity was destroyed and desires doubtsselfreproach and hopes reawokeuring the two days that elapsed before ostov called rincess arycontinually thought of how she ought to behave to him irst she decidednot to come to the drawing room when he called to see her auntthat itwould not be proper for her in her deep mourning to receive visitorsthen she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her thenit occurred to her that her aunt and the governors wife had intentionsconcerning herself and ostovtheir looks and words at times seemed toconfirm this suppositionthen she told herself that only she with hersinful nature could think this of them they could not forget thatsituated as she was while still wearing deep mourning such matchmakingwould be an insult to her and to her fathers memory ssuming that shedid go down to see him rincess ary imagined the words he would say toher and what she would say to him and these words sometimes seemedundeservedly cold and then to mean too much ore than anything shefeared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her assoon as she saw himut when on unday after church the footman announced in the drawingroom that ount ostov had called the princess showed no confusiononly a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a newand radiant lightou have met him unt said she in a calm voice unable herself tounderstand that she could be outwardly so calm and naturalhen ostov entered the room the princess dropped her eyes for aninstant as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt and then justas icholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look withshining eyes ith a movement full of dignity and grace she half rosewith a smile of pleasure held out her slender delicate hand to himand began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deepwomanly notes vibrated ademoiselle ourienne who was in the drawingroom looked at rincess ary in bewildered surprise erself aconsummate coquette she could not have maneuvered better on meeting aman she wished to attractither black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatlyimproved without my having noticed it nd above all what tact andgrace thought ademoiselle ouriennead rincess ary been capable of reflection at that moment she wouldhave been more surprised than ademoiselle ourienne at the change thathad taken place in herself rom the moment she recognized that dearloved face a new life force took possession of her and compelled her tospeak and act apart from her own will rom the time ostov entered herface became suddenly transformed t was as if a light had been kindledin a carved and painted lantern and the intricate skillful artisticwork on its sides that previously seemed dark coarse and meaninglesswas suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty or the firsttime all that pure spiritual inward travail through which she hadlived appeared on the surface ll her inward labor her dissatisfactionwith herself her sufferings her strivings after goodness hermeekness love and selfsacrificeall this now shone in those radianteyes in her delicate smile and in every trait of her gentle faceostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life efelt that the being before him was quite different from and betterthan anyone he had met before and above all better than himselfheir conversation was very simple and unimportant hey spoke of thewar and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow aboutit they spoke of their last meetingicholas trying to change thesubjectthey talked of the governors kind wife of icholasrelations and of rincess aryshe did not talk about her brother diverting the conversation as soonas her aunt mentioned ndrew vidently she could speak of ussiasmisfortunes with a certain artificiality but her brother was too nearher heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him icholasnoticed this as he noticed every shade of rincess arys characterwith an observation unusual to him and everything confirmed hisconviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary beingicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about theprincess as she did when he was mentioned and even when he thought ofher but in her presence he felt quite at ease and said not at all whathe had prepared but what quite appropriately occurred to him at themomenthen a pause occurred during his short visit icholas as is usual whenthere are children turned to rince ndrews little son caressing himand asking whether he would like to be an hussar e took the boy on hisknee played with him and looked round at rincess ary ith asoftened happy timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms ofthe man she loved icholas also noticed that look and as ifunderstanding it flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy withgood natured playfulnesss she was in mourning rincess ary did not go out into society andicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again but allthe same the governors wife went on with her matchmaking passing on toicholas the flattering things rincess ary said of him and vice versaand insisting on his declaring himself to rincess ary or thispurpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishopshouse before asshough ostov told the governors wife that he would not make anydeclaration to rincess ary he promised to gos at ilsit ostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybodyconsidered right was right so now after a short but sincere strugglebetween his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice andin obedient submission to circumstances he chose the latter and yieldedto the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where eknew that after his promise to onya it would be what he deemed base todeclare his feelings to rincess ary nd he knew that he would neveract basely ut he also knew or rather felt at the bottom of his heartthat by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to thosewho were guiding him he was not only doing nothing wrong but was doingsomething very importantmore important than anything he had ever donein his lifefter meeting rincess ary though the course of his life went onexternally as before all his former amusements lost their charm for himand he often thought about her ut he never thought about her as he hadthought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met insociety nor as he had for a long time and at one time rapturouslythought about onya e had pictured each of those young ladies asalmost all honesthearted young men do that is as a possible wifeadapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life awhite dressing gown his wife at the tea table his wifes carriagelittle ones amma and apa their relations to her and so onandthese pictures of the future had given him pleasure ut with rincessary to whom they were trying to get him engaged he could neverpicture anything of future married life f he tried his picturesseemed incongruous and false t made him afraid he dreadful news of the battle of orodino of our losses in killed andwounded and the still more terrible news of the loss of oscow reachedoronezh in the middle of eptember rincess ary having learned ofher brothers wound only from the azette and having no definite news ofhim prepared so icholas heard he had not seen her again himself toset off in search of rince ndrewhen he received the news of the battle of orodino and the abandonmentof oscow ostov was not seized with despair anger the desire forvengeance or any feeling of that kind but everything in oronezhsuddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome and he experienced anindefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness he conversations he heardseemed to him insincere he did not know how to judge all these affairsand felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clearto him e made haste to finish buying the horses and often becameunreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster few days before his departure a special thanksgiving at whichicholas was present was held in the cathedral for the ussian victorye stood a little behind the governor and held himself with militarydecorum through the service meditating on a great variety of subjectshen the service was over the governors wife beckoned him to herave you seen the princess she asked indicating with a movement ofher head a lady standing on the opposite side beyond the choiricholas immediately recognized rincess ary not so much by the profilehe saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude timidity andpity that immediately overcame him rincess ary evidently engrossedby her thoughts was crossing herself for the last time before leavingthe churchicholas looked at her face with surprise t was the same face he hadseen before there was the same general expression of refined innerspiritual labor but now it was quite differently lit up here was apathetic expression of sorrow prayer and hope in it s had occurredbefore when she was present icholas went up to her without waiting tobe prompted by the governors wife and not asking himself whether or notit was right and proper to address her here in church and told her hehad heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul s soon asshe heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face lighting up bothher sorrow and her joyhere is one thing  wanted to tell you rincess said ostov t isthat if your brother rince ndrew ikolievich were not living itwould have been at once announced in the azette as he is a colonelhe princess looked at him not grasping what he was saying but cheeredby the expression of regretful sympathy on his facend  have known so many cases of a splinter wound the azette saidit was a shell either proving fatal at once or being very slightcontinued icholas e must hope for the best and  am surerincess ary interrupted himh that would be so dread she began and prevented by agitationfrom finishing she bent her head with a movement as graceful aseverything she did in his presence and looking up at him gratefullywent out following her aunthat evening icholas did not go out but stayed at home to settle someaccounts with the horse dealers hen he had finished that business itwas already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bedand for a long time he paced up and down the room reflecting on hislife a thing he rarely didrincess ary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had mether in molensk province is having encountered her in such exceptionalcircumstances and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him asa good match had drawn his particular attention to her hen he met heragain in oronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasingbut powerful icholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty heobserved in her at this time e was however preparing to go away andit had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himselfof chances of meeting her ut that days encounter in church had hefelt sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind hat palesad refined face that radiant look those gentle graceful gesturesand especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her featuresagitated him and evoked his sympathy n men ostov could not bear tosee the expression of a higher spiritual life that was why he did notlike rince ndrew and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophyand dreaminess but in rincess ary that very sorrow which revealed thedepth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistibleattractionhe must be a wonderful woman  real angel he said to himself hyam  not free hy was  in such a hurry with onya nd heinvoluntarily compared the two the lack of spirituality in the one andthe abundance of it in the othera spirituality he himself lacked andtherefore valued most highly e tried to picture what would happen werehe free ow he would propose to her and how she would become his wifeut no he could not imagine that e felt awed and no clear picturepresented itself to his mind e had long ago pictured to himself afuture with onya and that was all clear and simple just because it hadall been thought out and he knew all there was in onya but it wasimpossible to picture a future with rincess ary because he did notunderstand her but simply loved hereveries about onya had had something merry and playful in them but todream of rincess ary was always difficult and a little frighteningow she prayed he thought t was plain that her whole soul was inher prayer es that was the prayer that moves mountains and  am sureher prayer will be answered hy dont  pray for what  want hesuddenly thought hat do  want o be free released from onyahe was right he thought remembering what the governors wife hadsaid othing but misfortune can come of marrying onya uddles grieffor amma business difficulties muddles terrible muddlesesides  dont love hernot as  should  od release me from thisdreadful inextricable position he suddenly began to pray esprayer can move mountains but one must have faith and not pray asatasha and  used to as children that the snow might turn into sugarand then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so o but am not praying for trifles now he thought as he put his pipe down in acorner and folding his hands placed himself before the icon oftenedby memories of rincess ary he began to pray as he had not done for along time ears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door openedand avrushka came in with some paperslockhead hy do you come in without being called cried icholasquickly changing his attituderom the governor said avrushka in a sleepy voice  courier hasarrived and theres a letter for youell all right thanks ou can goicholas took the two letters one of which was from his mother and theother from onya e recognized them by the handwriting and openedonyas first e had read only a few lines when he turned pale and hiseyes opened wide with fear and joyo its not possible he cried aloudnable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter andreading it e glanced through it then read it again and then againand standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shouldersstretching out his hands with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixedhat he had just been praying for with confidence that od would hearhim had come to pass but icholas was as much astonished as if it weresomething extraordinary and unexpected and as if the very fact that ithad happened so quickly proved that it had not come from od to whom hehad prayed but by some ordinary coincidencehis unexpected and as it seemed to icholas quite voluntary letterfrom onya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from whichthere had seemed no escape he wrote that the last unfortunate eventsthe loss of almost the whole of the ostovs oscow propertyand thecountess repeatedly expressed wish that icholas should marry rincessolkonskaya together with his silence and coldness of late had allcombined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set himcompletely freet would be too painful to me to think that  might be a cause of sorrowor discord in the family that has been so good to me she wrote and mylove has no aim but the happiness of those  love so icholas  begyou to consider yourself free and to be assured that in spite ofeverything no one can love you more than doesour onyaoth letters were written from roitsa he other from the countessdescribed their last days in oscow their departure the fire and thedestruction of all their property n this letter the countess alsomentioned that rince ndrew was among the wounded traveling with themhis state was very critical but the doctor said there was now morehope onya and atasha were nursing himext day icholas took his mothers letter and went to see rincessary either he nor she said a word about what atasha nursing himmight mean but thanks to this letter icholas suddenly became almost asintimate with the princess as if they were relationshe following day he saw rincess ary off on her journey to aroslavland a few days later left to rejoin his regiment onyas letter written from roitsa which had come as an answer toicholas prayer was prompted by this the thought of getting icholasmarried to an heiress occupied the old countess mind more and more heknew that onya was the chief obstacle to this happening and onyaslife in the countess house had grown harder and harder especiallyafter they had received a letter from icholas telling of his meetingwith rincess ary in ogucharovo he countess let no occasion slip ofmaking humiliating or cruel allusions to onyaut a few days before they left oscow moved and excited by all thatwas going on she called onya to her and instead of reproaching andmaking demands on her tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself andrepay all that the family had done for her by breaking off herengagement with icholas shall not be at peace till you promise me thisonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that shewould do anything and was prepared for anything but gave no actualpromise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded ofher he must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared andbrought her up o sacrifice herself for others was onyas habit erposition in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show herworth and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it ut in all herformer acts of selfsacrifice she had been happily conscious that theyraised her in her own esteem and in that of others and so made her moreworthy of icholas whom she loved more than anything in the world utnow they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted thewhole reward for her selfsacrifice and the whole meaning of her lifend for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had beenher benefactors only to torture her the more painfully she felt jealousof atasha who had never experienced anything of this sort had neverneeded to sacrifice herself but made others sacrifice themselves forher and yet was beloved by everybody nd for the first time onya feltthat out of her pure quiet love for icholas a passionate feeling wasbeginning to grow up which was stronger than principle virtue orreligion nder the influence of this feeling onya whose life ofdependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive having answeredthe countess in vague general terms avoided talking with her andresolved to wait till she should see icholas not in order to set himfree but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her foreverhe bustle and terror of the ostovs last days in oscow stifled thegloomy thoughts that oppressed onya he was glad to find escape fromthem in practical activity ut when she heard of rince ndrewspresence in their house despite her sincere pity for him and foratasha she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that oddid not intend her to be separated from icholas he knew that atashaloved no one but rince ndrew and had never ceased to love him heknew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstancesthey would again fall in love with one another and that icholas wouldthen not be able to marry rincess ary as they would be within theprohibited degrees of affinity espite all the terror of what hadhappened during those last days and during the first days of theirjourney this feeling that rovidence was intervening in her personalaffairs cheered onyat the roitsa monastery the ostovs first broke their journey for awhole dayhree large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry oneof which was occupied by rince ndrew he wounded man was much betterthat day and atasha was sitting with him n the next room sat thecount and countess respectfully conversing with the prior who wascalling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monasteryonya was there too tormented by curiosity as to what rince ndrew andatasha were talking about he heard the sound of their voices throughthe door hat door opened and atasha came out looking excited otnoticing the monk who had risen to greet her and was drawing back thewide sleeve on his right arm she went up to onya and took her handatasha what are you about ome here said the countessatasha went up to the monk for his blessing and he advised her to prayfor aid to od and is saints soon as the prior withdrew atasha took her friend by the hand andwent with her into the unoccupied roomonya will he live she asked onya how happy  am and howunhappy onya dovey everything is as it used to be f only helives e cannot because because of and atasha burst intotearses  knew it hank od murmured onya e will liveonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latters fear andgrief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no oneobbing she kissed and comforted atasha f only he lives shethought aving wept talked and wiped away their tears the twofriends went together to rince ndrews door atasha opened itcautiously and glanced into the room onya standing beside her at thehalfopen doorrince ndrew was lying raised high on three pillows is pale face wascalm his eyes closed and they could see his regular breathing atasha onya suddenly almost screamed catching her companionsarm and stepping back from the doorhat hat is it asked atashats that that said onya with a white face and trembling lipsatasha softly closed the door and went with onya to the window notyet understanding what the latter was telling herou remember said onya with a solemn and frightened expression ouremember when  looked in the mirror for you at tradnoe athristmas o you remember what  sawes yes cried atasha opening her eyes wide and vaguely recallingthat onya had told her something about rince ndrew whom she had seenlying downou remember onya went on  saw it then and told everybody youand unyasha  saw him lying on a bed said she making a gesture withher hand and a lifted finger at each detail and that he had his eyesclosed and was covered just with a pink quilt and that his hands werefolded she concluded convincing herself that the details she had justseen were exactly what she had seen in the mirrorhe had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing thatcame into her head but what she had invented then seemed to her now asreal as any other recollection he not only remembered what she hadthen saidthat he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered withsomething redbut was firmly convinced that she had then seen and saidthat he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closedes yes it really was pink cried atasha who now thought she tooremembered the word pink being used and saw in this the mostextraordinary and mysterious part of the predictionut what does it mean she added meditativelyh  dont know it is all so strange replied onya clutching ather head few minutes later rince ndrew rang and atasha went to him butonya feeling unusually excited and touched remained at the windowthinking about the strangeness of what had occurredhey had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army and thecountess was writing to her sononya said the countess raising her eyes from her letter as herniece passed onya wont you write to icholas he spoke in a softtremulous voice and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectaclesonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words hoseeyes expressed entreaty shame at having to ask fear of a refusal andreadiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusalonya went up to the countess and kneeling down kissed her handes amma  will write said sheonya was softened excited and touched by all that had occurred thatday especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of hervision ow that she knew that the renewal of atashas relations withrince ndrew would prevent icholas from marrying rincess ary shewas joyfully conscious of a return of that selfsacrificing spirit inwhich she was accustomed to live and loved to live o with a joyfulconsciousness of performing a magnanimous deedinterrupted severaltimes by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyesshe wrote thattouching letter the arrival of which had so amazed icholas he officer and soldiers who had arrested ierre treated him withhostility but yet with respect in the guardhouse to which he was takenn their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as towho he might beperhaps a very important personand hostility as aresult of their recent personal conflict with himut when the guard was relieved next morning ierre felt that for thenew guardboth officers and menhe was not as interesting as he hadbeen to his captors and in fact the guard of the second day did notrecognize in this big stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous personwho had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and haduttered those solemn words about saving a child they saw in him onlyo  of the captured ussians arrested and detained for some reasonby order of the igher ommand f they noticed anything remarkableabout ierre it was only his unabashed meditative concentration andthoughtfulness and the way he spoke rench which struck them assurprisingly good n spite of this he was placed that day with theother arrested suspects as the separate room he had occupied wasrequired by an officerll the ussians confined with ierre were men of the lowest class andrecognizing him as a gentleman they all avoided him more especially ashe spoke rench ierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of himhat evening he learned that all these prisoners he probably amongthem were to be tried for incendiarism n the third day he was takenwith the others to a house where a rench general with a white mustachesat with two colonels and other renchmen with scarves on their armsith the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisonersand which is supposed to preclude human frailty ierre like the otherswas questioned as to who he was where he had been with what objectand so onhese questions like questions put at trials generally left theessence of the matter aside shut out the possibility of that essencesbeing revealed and were designed only to form a channel through whichthe judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead tothe desired result namely a conviction s soon as ierre began to sayanything that did not fit in with that aim the channel was removed andthe water could flow to waste ierre felt moreover what the accusedalways feel at their trial perplexity as to why these questions wereput to him e had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or akind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed eknew he was in these mens power that only by force had they broughthim there that force alone gave them the right to demand answers totheir questions and that the sole object of that assembly was toinculpate him nd so as they had the power and wish to inculpate himthis expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary t wasevident that any answer would lead to conviction hen asked what he wasdoing when he was arrested ierre replied in a rather tragic mannerthat he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from theflames hy had he fought the marauder ierre answered that he wasprotecting a woman and that to protect a woman who was being insultedwas the duty of every man that hey interrupted him for this wasnot to the point hy was he in the yard of a burning house wherewitnesses had seen him e replied that he had gone out to see what washappening in oscow gain they interrupted him they had not askedwhere he was going but why he was found near the fire ho was he theyasked repeating their first question which he had declined to answergain he replied that he could not answer itut that down thats bad very bad sternly remarked the generalwith the white mustache and red flushed facen the fourth day fires broke out on the ubovski rampartierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchantshouse near the rimean bridge n his way through the streets ierrefelt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole cityires were visible on all sides e did not then realize thesignificance of the burning of oscow and looked at the fires withhorrore passed four days in the coach house near the rimean bridge andduring that time learned from the talk of the rench soldiers that allthose confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any dayfrom the marshal hat marshal this was ierre could not learn from thesoldiers vidently for them the marshal represented a very high andrather mysterious powerhese first days before the eighth of eptember when the prisoners werehad up for a second examination were the hardest of all for ierre n the eighth of eptember an officera very important one judging bythe respect the guards showed himentered the coach house where theprisoners were his officer probably someone on the staff was holdinga paper in his hand and called over all the ussians there namingierre as the man who does not give his name lancing indolently andindifferently at all the prisoners he ordered the officer in charge tohave them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to themarshal n hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and ierre withthirteen others was led to the irgins ield t was a fine day sunnyafter rain and the air was unusually pure he smoke did not hang lowas on the day when ierre had been taken from the guardhouse on theubovski rampart but rose through the pure air in columns o flameswere seen but columns of smoke rose on all sides and all oscow as faras ierre could see was one vast charred ruin n all sides there werewaste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing andhere and there the blackened walls of some brick houses ierre gazed atthe ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well ere andthere he could see churches that had not been burned he remlin whichwas not destroyed gleamed white in the distance with its towers and thebelfry of van the reat he domes of the ew onvent of the irginglittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearlyhese bells reminded ierre that it was unday and the feast of theativity of the irgin ut there seemed to be no one to celebrate thisholiday everywhere were blackened ruins and the few ussians to beseen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they sawthe rencht was plain that the ussian nest was ruined and destroyed but inplace of the ussian order of life that had been destroyed ierreunconsciously felt that a quite different firm rench order had beenestablished over this ruined nest e felt this in the looks of thesoldiers who marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily wereescorting him and the other criminals he felt it in the looks of animportant rench official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldierwhom they met on the way e felt it in the merry sounds of regimentalmusic he heard from the left side of the field and felt and realized itespecially from the list of prisoners the rench officer had read outwhen he came that morning ierre had been taken by one set of soldiersand led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other menand it seemed that they might have forgotten him or confused him withthe others ut no the answers he had given when questioned had comeback to him in his designation as the man who does not give his nameand under that appellation which to ierre seemed terrible they werenow leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their facesthat he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wantedand that they were being taken to the proper place ierre felt himselfto be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whoseaction he did not understand but which was working welle and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the irginsield to a large white house with an immense garden not far from theconvent his was rince hcherbitovs house where ierre had oftenbeen in other days and which as he learned from the talk of thesoldiers was now occupied by the marshal the uke of ckmuhl avouthey were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by oneierre was the sixth to enter e was conducted through a glass galleryan anteroom and a hall which were familiar to him into a long lowstudy at the door of which stood an adjutantavout spectacles on nose sat bent over a table at the further end ofthe room ierre went close up to him but avout evidently

rench general but a man notorious for hiscruelty ooking at his cold face as he sat like a stern schoolmasterwho was prepared to wait awhile for an answer ierre felt that everyinstant of delay might cost him his life but he did not know what tosay e did not venture to repeat what he had said at his firstexamination yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous andembarrassing o he was silent ut before he had decided what to doavout raised his head pushed his spectacles back on his foreheadscrewed up his eyes and looked intently at him know that man he said in a cold measured tone evidentlycalculated to frighten ierrehe chill that had been running down ierres back now seized his headas in a viseou cannot know me eneral  have never seen youe is a ussian spy avout interrupted

an offended but in a pleadingvoiceavout looked up and gazed intently at him or some seconds they lookedat one another and that look saved ierre part from conditions of warand law that look established human relations between the two men tthat moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both theirminds and they realized that they were both children of humanity andwere brotherst the first

which a post had been set up eyond that post a fresh pit had beendug in the ground and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood ina semicircle he crowd consisted of a few ussians and many ofapoleons soldiers who were not on dutyermans talians andrenchmen in a variety of uniforms o the right and left of the poststood rows of rench troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and highboots and shakoshe prisoners were placed in a certain order according to the listierre was sixth and were led to the post everal drums suddenlybegan to beat on both sides of them and at that sound ierre felt as ifpart of his soul had been torn away e lost the power of thinking orunderstanding e could only hear and see nd he had only one wishthat the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quicklyierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized themhe two first were convicts with shaven heads ne was tall and thinthe other dark shaggy and sinewy with a flat nose he third was adomestic serf about fortyfive years old with grizzled hair and aplump wellnourished body he fourth was a peasant a very handsomeman with a broad lightbrown beard and black eyes he fifth was afactory hand a thin sallowfaced lad of eighteen in a loose coatierre heard the rench consulting whether to shoot them separately ortwo at a time n couples replied the officer in command in a calmvoice here was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evidentthat they were all hurryingnot as men hurry to do something theyunderstand but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant andincomprehensible task rench official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row ofprisoners and read out the sentence in ussian and in renchhen two pairs of renchmen approached the criminals and at theofficers command took the two convicts who stood first in the row heconvicts stopped when they reached the post and while sacks were beingbrought looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approachinghuntsman ne crossed himself continually the other scratched his backand made a movement of the lips resembling a smile ith hurried handsthe soldiers blindfolded them drawing the sacks over their heads andbound them to the postwelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firmregular tread and halted eight paces from the post ierre turned awayto avoid seeing what was going to happen uddenly a crackling rollingnoise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrificthunder and he looked round here was some smoke and the renchmenwere doing something near the pit with pale faces and trembling handswo more prisoners were led up n the same way and with similar looksthese two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal forprotection in their eyes evidently unable to understand or believe whatwas going to happen to them hey could not believe it because theyalone knew what their life meant to them and so they neither understoodnor believed that it could be taken from themgain ierre did not wish to look and again turned away but again thesound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear and at the same momenthe saw smoke blood and the pale scared faces of the renchmen whowere again doing something by the post their trembling hands impedingone another ierre breathing heavily looked around as if asking whatit meant he same question was expressed in all the looks that met hisn the faces of all the ussians and of the rench soldiers and officerswithout exception he read the same dismay horror and conflict thatwere in his own heart ut who after all is doing this hey are allsuffering as  am ho then is it ho flashed for an instant throughhis mindharpshooters of the th forward shouted someone he fifthprisoner the one next to ierre was led awayalone ierre did notunderstand that he was saved that he and the rest had been broughtthere only to witness the execution ith evergrowing horror and nosense of joy or relief he gazed at what was taking place he fifth manwas the factory lad in the loose cloak he moment they laid hands onhim he sprang aside in terror and clutched at ierre ierre shudderedand shook himself free he lad was unable to walk hey dragged himalong holding him up under the arms and he screamed hen they got himto the post he grew quiet as if he suddenly understood somethinghether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thoughtit incredible that men should kill him at any rate he took his stand atthe post waiting to be blindfolded like the others and like a woundedanimal looked around him with glittering eyesierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes is curiosityand agitation like that of the whole crowd reached the highest pitchat this fifth murder ike the others this fifth man seemed calm hewrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the otherhen they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which hurtthe back of his head then when they propped him against thebloodstained post he leaned back and not being comfortable in thatposition straightened himself adjusted his feet and leaned back againmore comfortably ierre did not take his eyes from him and did not misshis slightest movementrobably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports ofeight muskets but try as he would ierre could not afterwards rememberhaving heard the slightest sound of the shots e only saw how theworkman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him how blood showeditself in two places how the ropes slackened under the weight of thehanging body and how the workman sat down his head hanging unnaturallyand one leg bent under him ierre ran up to the post o one hinderedhim ale frightened people were doing something around the workmanhe lower jaw of an old renchman with a thick mustache trembled as heuntied the ropes he body collapsed he soldiers dragged it awkwardlyfrom the post and began pushing it into the pithey all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who musthide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possibleierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying withhis knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the otherhat shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively but spadefulsof earth were already being thrown over the whole body ne of thesoldiers evidently suffering shouted gruffly and angrily at ierre togo back ut ierre did not understand him and remained near the postand no one drove him awayhen the pit had been filled up a command was given ierre was takenback to his place and the rows of troops on both sides of the post madea half turn and went past it at a measured pace he twentyfoursharpshooters with discharged muskets standing in the center of thecircle ran back to their places as the companies passed byierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran incouples out of the circle ll but one rejoined their companies hisone a young soldier his face deadly pale his shako pushed back andhis musket resting on the ground still stood near the pit at the spotfrom which he had fired e swayed like a drunken man taking some stepsforward and back to save himself from falling n old noncommissionedofficer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him tohis company he crowd of ussians and renchmen began to disperse heyall went away silently and with drooping headshat will teach them to start fires said one of the renchmenierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier whowas trying to find some relief after what had been done but was notable to do so ithout finishing what he had begun to say he made ahopeless movement with his arm and went away fter the execution ierre was separated from the rest of the prisonersand placed alone in a small ruined and befouled churchoward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers andtold him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks forthe prisoners of war ithout understanding what was said to him ierregot up and went with the soldiers hey took him to the upper end of thefield where there were some sheds built of charred planks beams andbattens and led him into one of them n the darkness some twentydifferent men surrounded ierre e looked at them without understandingwho they were why they were there or what they wanted of him e heardwhat they said but did not understand the meaning of the words and madeno kind of deduction from or application of them e replied toquestions they put to him but did not consider who was listening to hisreplies nor how they would understand them e looked at their facesand figures but they all seemed to him equally meaninglessrom the moment ierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed bymen who did not wish to commit them it was as if the mainspring of hislife on which everything depended and which made everything appearalive had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed intoa heap of meaningless rubbish hough he did not acknowledge it tohimself his faith in the right ordering of the universe in humanityin his own soul and in od had been destroyed e had experienced thisbefore but never so strongly as now hen similar doubts had assailedhim before they had been the result of his own wrongdoing and at thebottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and fromthose doubts was to be found within himself ut now he felt that theuniverse had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruinsremained and this not by any fault of his own e felt that it was notin his power to regain faith in the meaning of liferound him in the darkness men were standing and evidently somethingabout him interested them greatly hey were telling him something andasking him something hen they led him away somewhere and at last hefound himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing andtalking on all sidesell then mates that very prince who some voice at the otherend of the shed was saying with a strong emphasis on the word whoitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wallierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes ut as soon as heclosed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory ladespecially dreadful because of its simplicityand the faces of themurderers even more dreadful because of their disquiet nd he openedhis eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around himeside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence hewas first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came fromhim every time he moved his man was doing something to his legs in thedarkness and though ierre could not see his face he felt that the mancontinually glanced at him n growing used to the darkness ierre sawthat the man was taking off his leg bands and the way he did it arousedierres interestaving unwound the string that tied the band on one leg he carefullycoiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg glancing upat ierre hile one hand hung up the first string the other was alreadyunwinding the band on the second leg n this way having carefullyremoved the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following oneanother uninterruptedly the man hung the leg bands up on some pegsfixed above his head hen he took out a knife cut something closedthe knife placed it under the head of his bed and seating himselfcomfortably clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyeson ierre he latter was conscious of something pleasant comfortingand wellrounded in these deft movements in the mans wellorderedarrangements in his corner and even in his very smell and he looked atthe man without taking his eyes from himouve seen a lot of trouble sir eh the little man suddenly saidnd there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voicethat ierre tried to reply but his jaw trembled and he felt tearsrising to his eyes he little fellow giving ierre no time to betrayhis confusion instantly continued in the same pleasant tonesh lad dont fret

mong these folk too there are good menas well as bad said he and still speaking he turned on his kneeswith a supple movement got up coughed and went off to another part ofthe shedh you rascal ierre

repeatingord esus hrist holy aint icholas rola and avra ord esushrist holy aint icholas rola and avra ord esus hrist havemercy on us and save us he concluded then bowed to the ground gotup sighed and sat down again on his heap of straw hats the wayay me down like a stone  od and raise me up like a loaf hemuttered as he lay down pulling his coat over himhat prayer was that you were saying asked ierreh murmured laton who had almost fallen asleep hat was  saying was praying ont you prayes  do said ierre ut what was that you said rola and avraell of course replied laton quickly the horses saints ne mustpity the animals too h the rascal ow youve curled up and got warmyou daughter of a bitch said arataev touching the dog that lay athis feet and again turning over he fell asleep immediatelyounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distanceoutside and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed butinside it was quiet and dark or a long time ierre did not sleep butlay with eyes open in the darkness listening to the regular snoring oflaton who lay beside him and he felt that the world that had beenshattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and onnew and unshakable foundations wentythree soldiers three officers and two officials were confinedin the shed in which ierre had been placed and where he remained forfour weekshen ierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures tohim except laton arataev who always remained in his mind a most vividand precious memory and the personification of everything ussiankindly and round hen ierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn thefirst impression of him as of something round was fully confirmedlatons whole figurein a rench overcoat girdled with a cord asoldiers cap and bast shoeswas round is head was quite round hisback chest shoulders and even his arms which he held as if everready to embrace something were rounded his pleasant smile and hislarge gentle brown eyes were also roundlaton arataev must have been fifty judging by his stories ofcampaigns he had been in told as by an old soldier e did not himselfknow his age and was quite unable to determine it ut his brilliantlywhite strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when helaughedas he often didwere all sound and good there was not a grayhair in his beard or on his head and his whole body gave an impressionof suppleness and especially of firmness and enduranceis face despite its fine rounded wrinkles had an expression ofinnocence and youth his voice was pleasant and musical ut the chiefpeculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness t wasevident that he never considered what he had said or was going to sayand consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had anirresistible persuasivenessis physical strength and agility during the first days of hisimprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue andsickness meant very night before lying down he said ord lay medown as a stone and raise me up as a loaf and every morning on gettingup he said  lay down and curled up  get up and shake myself ndindeed he only had to lie down to fall asleep like a stone and he onlyhad to shake himself to be ready without a moments delay for somework just as children are ready to play directly they awake e coulddo everything not very well but not badly e baked cooked sewedplaned and mended boots e was always busy and only at night allowedhimself conversationof which he was fondand songs e did not singlike a trained singer who knows he is listened to but like the birdsevidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretchesoneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness and the sounds werealways highpitched mournful delicate and almost feminine and hisface at such times was very seriousaving been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow he seemed tohave thrown off all that had been forced upon himeverything militaryand alien to himselfand had returned to his former peasant habits soldier on leavea shirt outside breeches he would saye did not like talking about his life as a soldier though he did notcomplain and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once duringthe whole of his army service hen he related anything it was generallysome old and evidently precious memory of his hristian life as hecalled his peasant existence he proverbs of which his talk was fullwere for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employbut those folk sayings which taken without a context seem soinsignificant but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significanceof profound wisdome would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previousoccasion yet both would be right e liked to talk and he talked welladorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings whichierre thought he invented himself but the chief charm of his talk layin the fact that the commonest eventssometimes just such as ierre hadwitnessed without taking notice of themassumed in arataevs acharacter of solemn fitness e liked to hear the folk tales one of thesoldiers used to tell of an evening they were always the same butmost of all he liked to hear stories of real life e would smilejoyfully when listening to such stories now and then putting in a wordor asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clearto himself arataev had no attachments friendships or love as ierreunderstood them but loved and lived affectionately with everything lifebrought him in contact with particularly with mannot any particularman but those with whom he happened to be e loved his dog hiscomrades the rench and ierre who was his neighbor but ierre feltthat in spite of arataevs affectionate tenderness for him by which heunconsciously gave ierres spiritual life its due he would not havegrieved for a moment at parting from him nd ierre began to feel inthe same way toward arataevo all the other prisoners laton arataev seemed a most ordinarysoldier hey called him little falcon or latosha chaffed himgoodnaturedly and sent him on errands ut to ierre he alwaysremained what he had seemed that first night an unfathomable roundedeternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truthlaton arataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers hen he beganto speak he seemed not to know how he would concludeometimes ierre struck by the meaning of his words would ask him torepeat them but laton could never recall what he had said a momentbefore just as he never could repeat to ierre the words of hisfavorite song native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred init but when spoken and not sung no meaning could be got out of it edid not and could not understand the meaning of words apart from theircontext very word and action of his was the manifestation of anactivity unknown to him which was his life ut his life as heregarded it had no meaning as a separate thing t had meaning only aspart of a whole of which he was always conscious is words and actionsflowed from him as evenly inevitably and spontaneously as fragranceexhales from a flower e could not understand the value or significanceof any word or deed taken separately hen rincess ary heard from icholas that her brother was with theostovs at aroslavl she at once prepared to go there in spite of heraunts efforts to dissuade herand not merely to go herself but to takeher nephew with her hether it were difficult or easy possible orimpossible she did not ask and did not want to know it was her dutynot only to herself to be near her brother who was perhaps dying butto do everything possible to take his son to him and so she prepared toset off hat she had not heard from rince ndrew himself rincessary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering thelong journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his sonn a few days rincess ary was ready to start

difficult journey ademoiselle ourienne essalles andrincess arys servants were astonished at her energy and firmness ofspirit he went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them and nodifficulties daunted her hanks to her activity and energy whichinfected her fellow travelers they approached aroslavl by the end ofthe second weekhe last days of her stay in oronezh had been the happiest of her lifeer love for ostov no longer tormented or agitated her t filled herwhole soul had become an integral part of herself and she no longerstruggled against it atterly she had become convinced that she lovedand was beloved though she never said this definitely to herself inwords he had become convinced of it at her last interview withicholas when he had come to tell her that her brother was with theostovs ot by a single word had icholas alluded to the fact thatrince ndrews relations with atasha might if he recovered berenewed but rincess ary saw by his face that he knew and thought ofthiset in spite of that his relation to herconsiderate delicate andlovingnot only remained unchanged but it sometimes seemed to rincessary that he was even glad that the family connection between themallowed him to express his friendship more freely he knew that sheloved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she wasbeloved and was happy in regard to itut this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not preventher feeling grief for her brother with full force on the contrary thatspiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for herto give full play to her feeling for her brother hat feeling was sostrong at the moment of leaving oronezh that those who saw her off asthey looked at her careworn despairing face felt sure she would fallill on the journey ut the very difficulties and preoccupations of thejourney which she took so actively in hand saved her for a while fromher grief and gave her strengths always happens when traveling rincess ary thought only of thejourney itself forgetting its object ut as she approached aroslavlthe thought of what might await her therenot after many days but thatvery eveningagain presented itself to her and her agitation increasedto its utmost limithe courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where theostovs were staying in aroslavl and in what condition rince ndrewwas when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalledby the terrible pallor of the princess face that looked out at him fromthe window have found out everything your excellency the ostovs are stayingat the merchant ronnikovs house in the quare not far from hereright above the olga said the courierrincess ary looked at him with frightened inquiry not understandingwhy he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know how was herbrother ademoiselle ourienne put that question for herow is the prince she askedis excellency is staying in the same house with themhen he is alive thought rincess ary and asked in a low voiceow is hehe servants say he is still the samehat still the same might mean rincess ary did not ask but with anunnoticed glance at little sevenyearold icholas who was sitting infront of her looking with pleasure at the town she bowed her head anddid not raise it again till the heavy coach rumbling shaking andswaying came to a stop he carriage steps clattered as they were letdownhe carriage door was opened n the left there was watera greatriverand on the right a porch here were people at the entranceservants and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair smiling asit seemed to rincess ary in an unpleasantly affected way his wasonya rincess ary ran up the steps his way this way said thegirl with the same artificial smile and the princess found herself inthe hall facing an elderly woman of riental type who came rapidly tomeet her with a look of emotion his was the countess he embracedrincess ary and kissed heron enfant she muttered je vous aime et vous connais depuislongtemps  y child  love you and have known you a long timeespite her excitement rincess ary realized that this was thecountess and that it was necessary to say something to her ardlyknowing how she did it she contrived to utter a few polite phrases inrench in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her andasked ow is hehe doctor says that he is not in danger said the countess but

wastalking to ademoiselle ourienne he countess caressed the boy andthe old count came in and welcomed the princess e had changed verymuch since rincess ary had last seen him hen he had been a briskcheerful selfassured old man now he seemed a pitiful bewilderedperson hile talking to rincess ary he continually looked round as ifasking everyone whether he was doing the right thing fter thedestruction of oscow and of his property thrown out of his accustomedgroove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and tofeel that there was no longer a place for him in lifen spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible andher vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him theyshould be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephewthe princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt thenecessity of submitting for a time to this new order of things whichshe had entered he knew it to be necessary and though it was hard forher she was not vexed with these peoplehis is my niece said the count introducing onyaou dont knowher rincessrincess ary turned to onya and trying to stifle the hostile feelingthat arose in her toward the girl she kissed her ut she feltoppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so farfrom what was in her own hearthere is he she asked again addressing them alle is downstairs atasha is with him answered onya flushing ehave sent to ask  think you must be tired rincessears of vexation showed themselves in rincess arys eyes he turnedaway and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him whenlight impetuous and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the doorhe princess looked round and saw atasha coming in almost runningthat atasha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in oscowlong sinceut hardly had the princess looked at atashas face before she realizedthat here was a real comrade in her grief and consequently a friendhe ran to meet her embraced her and began to cry on her shoulders soon as atasha sitting at the head of rince ndrews bed heard ofrincess arys arrival she softly left his room and hastened to herwith those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to rincess aryhere was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into thedrawing roomthat of loveboundless love for him for her and for allthat was near to the man she loved and of pity suffering for othersand passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them t wasplain that at that moment there was in atashas heart no thought ofherself or of her own relations with rince ndrewrincess ary with her acute sensibility understood all this at thefirst glance at atashas face and wept on her shoulder with sorrowfulpleasureome come to him ary said atasha leading her into the otherroomrincess ary raised her head dried her eyes and turned to atashahe felt that from her she would be able to understand and learneverythingow she began her question but stopped shorthe felt that it was impossible to ask or to answer in wordsatashas face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly andprofoundlyatasha was gazing at her but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to sayall she knew or not she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyeswhich penetrated into the very depths of her heart it was impossiblenot to tell the whole truth which she saw nd suddenly atashas lipstwitched ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth and covering her facewith her hands she burst into sobsrincess ary understoodut she still hoped and asked in words she herself did not trustut how is his wound hat is his general conditionou you will see was all atasha could sayhey sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left offcrying and were able to go to him with calm facesow has his whole illness gone s it long since he grew worse hendid this happen rincess ary inquiredatasha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverishcondition and the pain he suffered but at roitsa that had passed andthe doctor had only been afraid of gangrene hat danger had alsopassed hen they reached aroslavl the wound had begun to festeratasha knew all about such things as festering and the doctor hadsaid that the festering might take a normal course hen fever set inbut the doctor had said the fever was not very seriousut two days ago this suddenly happened said atasha struggling withher sobs  dont know why but you will see what he is likes he weaker hinner asked the princesso its not that but worse ou will see  ary he is too good hecannot cannot live because hen atasha opened rince ndrews door with a familiar movement andlet rincess ary pass into the room before her the princess felt thesobs in her throat ard as she had tried to prepare herself and nowtried to remain tranquil she knew that she would be unable to look athim without tearshe princess understood what atasha had meant by the words two daysago this suddenly happened he understood those words to mean that hehad suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signsof approaching death s she stepped to the door she already saw inimagination ndrews face as she remembered it in childhood a gentlemild sympathetic face which he had rarely shown and which thereforeaffected her very strongly he was sure he would speak soft tenderwords to her such as her father had uttered before his death and thatshe would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in hispresence et sooner or later it had to be and she went in he sobsrose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearlydistinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out hisfeatures and then she saw his face and met his gazee was lying in a squirrelfur

words histone and especially in that calm almost antagonistic look could befelt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world terriblein one who is alive vidently only with an effort did he understandanything living but it was obvious that he failed to understand notbecause he lacked the power to do so but because he understood somethingelsesomething the living did not and could not understandand whichwholly occupied his mindhere you see how strangely fate has brought us together said hebreaking the silence and pointing to atasha he looks after me allthe timerincess ary heard him and did not understand how he could say such athing e the sensitive tender rince ndrew how could he say thatbefore her whom he loved and who loved him ad he expected to live hecould not have said those words in that offensively cold tone f he hadnot known that he was dying how could he have failed to pity her andhow could he speak like that in her presence he only explanation wasthat he was indifferent because something else much more importanthad been revealed to himhe conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke offary came by way of yazan said atasharince ndrew did not notice that she called his sister ary and onlyafter calling her so in his presence did atasha notice it herselfeally he askedhey told her that all oscow has been burned down and thatatasha stopped t

mustache with his fingersnd so you have met ount icholas ary rince ndrew suddenly saidevidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them e wrote here that hetook a great liking to you he went on simply and calmly evidentlyunable to understand all the complex significance his words had forliving people f you liked him too it would be a good thing for youto get married he added rather more quickly as if pleased at havingfound words he had long been seekingrincess ary heard his words but they had no meaning for her except asa proof of how far away he now was from everything livinghy talk of me she said quietly and glanced at atashaatasha who felt her glance did not look at her ll three were againsilentndrew would you like rincess ary suddenly said in a tremblingvoice would you like to see little icholas e is always talkingabout yourince ndrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time butrincess ary who knew his face so well saw with horror that he didnot smile with pleasure or

that she was crying atthe thought that little icholas would be left without a father ith agreat effort he tried to return to life and to see things from theirpoint of viewes to them it must seem sad he thought ut how simple it ishe fowls of the air sow not neither do they reap yet your atherfeedeth them he said to himself and wished to say to rincess arybut no they will take it their own way they wont understand heycant understand that all those feelings they prize soall ourfeelings all those ideas that seem so important to us are unnecessarye cannot understand one another and he remained silentrince ndrews little son was seven e could scarcely read and knewnothing fter that day he lived through many things gaining knowledgeobservation and experience but had he possessed all the faculties heafterwards acquired he could not have had a better or more profoundunderstanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between hisfather ary and atasha than he had then e understood itcompletely and leaving the room without crying went silently up toatasha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with hisbeautiful thoughtful eyes then his uplifted rosy upper lip trembledand leaning his head against her he began to cryfter that he avoided essalles and the countess who caressed him andeither sat alone or came timidly to rincess ary or to atasha of whomhe seemed even fonder than of his aunt and clung to them quietly andshylyhen rincess ary had left rince ndrew she fully understood whatatashas face had told her he did not speak any more to atasha ofhopes of saving his life he took turns with her beside his sofa anddid not cry any more but prayed continually turning in soul to thatternal and nfathomable whose presence above the dying man was now soevident ot only did rince ndrew know he would die but he felt that he wasdying and was already half dead e was conscious of an aloofness fromeverything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existenceithout haste or agitation he awaited what was coming hat inexorableeternal distant and unknown the presence of which he had feltcontinually all his lifewas now near to him and by the strangelightness he experienced almost comprehensible and palpableormerly he had feared the end e had twice experienced that terriblytormenting fear of deaththe endbut now he no longer understood thatfeare had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top beforehim and he looked at the fallow field the bushes and the sky andknew that he was face to face with death hen he came to himself afterbeing wounded and the flower of eternal unfettered love had instantlyunfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life thathad restrained it he no longer feared death and ceased to think aboutituring the hours of solitude suffering and partial delirium he spentafter he was wounded the more deeply he penetrated into the newprinciple of eternal love revealed to him the more he unconsciouslydetached himself from earthly life o love everything and everybody andalways to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone not tolive this earthly life nd the more imbued he became with thatprinciple of love the more he renounced life and the more completely hedestroyed that dreadful barrier whichin the absence of such lovestands between life and death hen during those first days heremembered that he would have to die he said to himself ell what ofit o much the betterut after the night in ytishchi when half delirious he had seen herfor whom he longed appear before him and having pressed her hand to hislips had shed gentle happy tears love for a particular woman againcrept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life ndjoyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind ecalling themoment at the ambulance station when he had seen uragin he could notnow regain the feeling he then had but was tormented by the questionwhether uragin was alive nd he dared not inquireis illness pursued its normal physical course but what atashareferred to when she said his suddenly happened had occurred twodays before rincess ary arrived t was the last spiritual strugglebetween life and death in which death gained the victory t was theunexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life aspresented to him in the form of his love for atasha and a last thoughultimately vanquished attack of terror before the unknownt was evening s usual after dinner he was slightly feverish and histhoughts were preternaturally clear onya was sitting by the table ebegan to doze uddenly a feeling of happiness seized himh she has come thought hend so it was in onyas place sat atasha who had just come innoiselesslyince she had begun looking after him he had always experienced thisphysical consciousness of her nearness he was sitting in an armchairplaced sideways screening the light of the candle from him and wasknitting a stocking he had learned to knit stockings since rincendrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as oldnurses who knit stockings and that there is something soothing in theknitting of stockings he needles clicked lightly in her slenderrapidly moving hands and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile ofher drooping face he moved and the ball rolled off her knees hestarted glanced round at him and screening the candle with her handstooped carefully with a supple and exact movement picked up the balland regained her former positione looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deepbreath after stooping but refrained from doing so and breathedcautiouslyt the roitsa monastery they had spoken of the past and he had toldher that if he lived he would always thank od for his wound which hadbrought them together again but after that they never spoke of thefuturean it or can it not be he now thought as he looked at her andlistened to the light click of the steel needles an fate have broughtme to her so strangely only for me to die s it possible that thetruth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that  have spentmy life in falsity  love her more than anything in the world ut whatam  to do if  love her he thought and he involuntarily groanedfrom a habit acquired during his sufferingsn hearing that sound atasha put down the stocking leaned nearer tohim and suddenly noticing his shining eyes stepped lightly up to himand bent over himou are not asleepo  have been looking at you a long time  felt you come in o oneelse gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do that light want to weep for joyatasha drew closer to him er face shone with rapturous joyatasha  love you too much ore than anything in the worldnd he turned away for an

with a passionate movemente remained silent awhileow good it would be and taking her hand he kissed itatasha felt happy and agitated but at once remembered that this wouldnot do and that he had to be quietut you have not slept she said repressing her joy ry to sleeppleasee pressed her hand and released it and she went back to the candle andsat down again in her former position wice she turned and looked athim and her eyes met his beaming at her he set herself a task on herstocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finishedoon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep e did not sleep long andsuddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspirations he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that nowalways occupied his mindabout life and death and chiefly about deathe felt himself nearer to itove hat is love he thoughtove hinders death ove is life ll everything that  understand understand only because  love verything is everything exists onlybecause  love verything is united by it alone ove is od and todie means that  a particle of love shall return to the general andeternal source hese thoughts seemed to him comforting ut they wereonly thoughts omething was lacking in them they were not clear theywere too onesidedly personal and brainspun nd there was the formeragitation and obscurity e fell asleepe dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in but that hewas quite well and unwounded any various indifferent andinsignificant people appeared before him e talked to them anddiscussed something trivial hey were preparing to go away somewhererince ndrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he hadmore important cares but he continued to speak surprising them byempty witticisms radually unnoticed all these persons began todisappear and a single question that of the closed door superseded allelse e rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it verythingdepended on whether he was or was not in time to lock it e went andtried to hurry but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not bein time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers ewas seized by an agonizing fear nd that fear was the fear of death tstood behind the door ut just when he was clumsily creeping toward thedoor that dreadful something on the other side was already pressingagainst it and forcing its way in omething not humandeathwasbreaking in through that door and had to be kept out e seized thedoor making a final effort to hold it backto lock it was no longerpossiblebut his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door pushed frombehind by that terror opened and closed againnce again it pushed from outside is last superhuman efforts were vainand both halves of the door noiselessly opened t entered and it wasdeath and rince ndrew diedut at the instant he died rince ndrew remembered that he was asleepand at the very instant he died having made an effort he awokees it was death  diedand woke up es death is an awakeningnd all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had tillthen concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision e feltas if powers till then confined within him had been liberated and thatstrange lightness did not again leave himhen waking in a cold perspiration he moved on the divan atasha wentup and asked him what was the matter e did not answer and looked ather strangely not understandinghat was what had happened to him two days before rincess arysarrival rom that day as the doctor expressed it the wasting feverassumed a malignant character but what the doctor said did not interestatasha she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were moreconvincingrom that day an awakening from life came to rince ndrew together withhis awakening from sleep nd compared to the duration of life it didnot seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to theduration of a dreamhere was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slowawakeningis last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way othrincess ary and atasha who did not leave him felt this hey didnot weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt thatthey were not attending on him he was no longer there he had leftthem but on what reminded them most closely of himhis body oth feltthis so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did notaffect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their griefeither in his presence nor out of it did they weep nor did they evertalk to one another about him hey felt that they could not express inwords what they understoodhey both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly deeper and deeperaway from them and they both knew that this had to be so and that itwas righte confessed and received communion everyone came to take leave ofhim hen they brought his son to him he pressed his lips to the boysand turned away not because he felt it hard and sad rincess ary andatasha understood that but simply because he thought it was all thatwas required of him but when they told him to bless the boy he didwhat was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there wasanything else he should dohen the last convulsions of the body which the spirit was leavingoccurred rincess ary and atasha were presents it over said rincess ary when his body had for a few minuteslain motionless growing cold before them atasha went up looked atthe dead eyes and hastened to close them he closed them but did notkiss them but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of himhisbodyhere has he gone here is he nowhen the body washed and dressed lay in the coffin on a tableeveryone came to take leave of him and they all weptittle icholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexityhe countess and onya cried from pity for atasha and because he was nomore he old count cried because he felt that before long he toomust take the same terrible stepatasha and rincess ary also wept now but not because of their ownpersonal grief they wept with a reverent and softening emotion whichhad taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simpleand solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in theirpresence   ans mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness butthe desire to find those causes is implanted in mans soul nd withoutconsidering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one ofwhich taken separately may seem to be the cause he snatches at thefirst approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and sayshis is the cause n historical events where the actions of men arethe subject of observation the first and most primitive approximationto present itself was the will of the gods and after that the will ofthose who stood in the most prominent positionthe heroes of historyut we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic eventwhichlies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in ittobe convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control theactions of the mass but is itself continually controlled t may seem tobe a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning ofhistorical events this way or that yet there is the same differencebetween a man who says that the people of the est moved on the astbecause apoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened becauseit had to happen as there is between those who declared that the earthwas stationary and that the planets moved round it and those whoadmitted that they did not know what upheld the earth but knew therewere laws directing its movement and that of the other planets hereis and can be no cause of an historical event except the one cause ofall causes ut there are laws directing events and some of these lawsare known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehendhe discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quiteabandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one manjust as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets waspossible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of theearthhe historians consider that next to the battle of orodino and theoccupation of oscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire the mostimportant episode of the war of  was the movement of the ussianarmy from the yazana to the aluga road and to the arutino campthesocalled flank march across the rasnaya akhra iver hey ascribe theglory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as towhom the honor is due ven foreign historians including the renchacknowledge the genius of the ussian commanders when they speak of thatflank march ut it is hard to understand why military writers andfollowing them others consider this flank march to be the profoundconception of some one man who saved ussia and destroyed apoleon nthe first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and geniusof this movement lay for not much mental effort was needed to see thatthe best position for an army when it is not being attacked is wherethere are most provisions and even a dull boy of thirteen could haveguessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from oscowin  was on the aluga road o it is impossible to understand bywhat reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuverwas a profound one nd it is even more difficult to understand just whythey think that this maneuver was calculated to save ussia and destroythe rench for this flank march had it been preceded accompanied orfollowed by other circumstances might have proved ruinous to theussians and salutary for the rench f the position of the ussianarmy really began to improve from the time of that march it does not atall follow that the march was the cause of ithat flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to theussian army but might in other circumstances have led to itsdestruction hat would have happened had oscow not burned down furat had not lost sight of the ussians f apoleon had not remainedinactive f the ussian army at rasnaya akhra had given battle asennigsen and arclay advised hat would have happened had the renchattacked the ussians while they were marching beyond the akhra hatwould have happened if on approaching arutino apoleon had attackedthe ussians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when heattacked them at molensk hat would have happened had the rench movedon etersburg n any of these eventualities the flank march thatbrought salvation might have proved disastroushe third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studyinghistory deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot beattributed to any one man that no one ever foresaw it and that inreality like the retreat from ili it did not suggest itself to anyonein its entirety but resultedmoment by moment step by step event byeventfrom an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was onlyseen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to thepastt the council at ili the prevailing thought in the minds of theussian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself namely adirect retreat by the izhni road n proof of this there is the factthat the majority of the council voted for such a retreat and above allthere is the wellknown conversation after the council between thecommander in chief and anskoy who was in charge of the commissariatdepartment anskoy informed the commanderinchief that the armysupplies were for the most part stored along the ka in the ula andyazan provinces and that if they retreated on izhni the army would beseparated from its supplies by the broad river ka which cannot becrossed early in winter his was the first indication of the necessityof deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural courseadirect retreat on izhniovgorod he army turned more to the southalong the yazan road and nearer to its supplies ubsequently theinactivity of the rench who even lost sight of the ussian armyconcern for the safety of the arsenal at ula and especially theadvantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turnstill further south to the ula road aving crossed over by a forcedmarch to the ula road beyond the akhra the ussian commandersintended to remain at odolsk and had no thought of the arutinoposition but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of renchtroops who had for a time lost touch with the ussians and projects ofgiving battle and above all the abundance of provisions in alugaprovince obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to crossfrom the ula to the aluga road and go to arutino which was betweenthe roads along which those supplies lay ust as it is impossible tosay when it was decided to abandon oscow so it is impossible to sayprecisely when or by whom it was decided to move to arutino nlywhen the army had got there as the result of innumerable and varyingforces did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired thismovement and long ago foreseen its result he famous flank movement merely consisted in this after the advance ofthe rench had ceased the ussian army which had been continuallyretreating straight back from the invaders deviated from that directcourse and not finding itself pursued was naturally drawn toward thedistrict where supplies were abundantf instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading theussian army we picture that army without any leaders it could nothave done anything but make a return movement toward oscow describingan arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and wherethe country was richesthat movement from the izhni to the yazan ula and aluga roads wasso natural that even the ussian marauders moved in that direction anddemands were sent from etersburg for utuzov to take his army that wayt arutino utuzov received what was almost a reprimand from themperor for having moved his army along the yazan road and themperors letter indicated to him the very position he had alreadyoccupied near alugaaving rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by thewhole campaign and by the battle of orodino the ussian armywhen thestrength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was receivedassumed the position natural to itutuzovs merit lay not in any strategic maneuver of genius as it iscalled but in the fact that he alone understood the significance ofwhat had happened e alone then understood the meaning of the rencharmys inactivity he alone continued to assert that the battle oforodino had been a victory he alonewho as commanderinchief mighthave been expected to be eager to attackemployed his whole strength torestrain the ussian army from useless engagementshe beast wounded at orodino was lying where the fleeing hunter hadleft him but whether he was still alive whether he was strong andmerely lying low the hunter did not know uddenly the beast was heardto moanhe moan of that wounded beast the rench army which betrayed itscalamitous condition was the sending of auriston to utuzovs camp withovertures for peaceapoleon with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head wasright wrote to utuzov the first words that occurred to him thoughthey were meaningless     am sending one of my

looked on asthe initiator of a settlement of any sort uch is the present spirit ofmy nation ut he continued to exert all his powers to restrain histroops from attackinguring the month that the rench troops were pillaging in oscow and theussian troops were quietly encamped at arutino a change had takenplace in the relative strength of the two armiesboth in spirit and innumberas a result of which the superiority had passed to the ussianside hough the condition and numbers of the rench army were unknownto the ussians as soon as that change occurred the need of attackingat once showed itself by countless signs hese signs were auristonsmission the abundance of provisions at arutino the reports coming infrom all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the rench the flow ofrecruits to our regiments the fine weather the long rest the ussiansoldiers had enjoyed and the impatience to do what they had beenassembled for which usually shows itself in an army that has beenresting curiosity as to what the rench army so long lost sight ofwas doing the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up tothe rench stationed at arutino the news of easy successes gained bypeasants and guerrilla troops over the rench the envy aroused by thisthe desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every ussian as long asthe rench were in oscow and above all a dim consciousness in everysoldiers mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed andthat the advantage was now on our side here was a substantial changein the relative strength and an advance had become inevitable nd atonce as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute handhas completed a full circle this change was shown by an increasedactivity whirring and chiming in the higher spheres he ussian army was commanded by utuzov and his staff and also by themperor from etersburg efore the news of the abandonment of oscowhad been received in etersburg a detailed plan of the whole campaignhad been drawn up and sent to utuzov for his guidance hough this planhad been drawn up on the supposition that oscow was still in our handsit was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action utuzovonly replied that movements arranged from a distance were alwaysdifficult to execute o fresh instructions were sent for the solutionof difficulties that might be encountered as well as fresh people whowere to watch utuzovs actions and report upon themesides this the whole staff of the ussian army was now reorganizedhe posts left vacant by agration who had been killed and by arclaywho had gone away in dudgeon had to be filled ery seriousconsideration was given to the question whether it would be better toput  in s place and  in s or on the contrary to put  in splace and so onas if anything more than s or s satisfactiondepended on thiss a result of the hostility between utuzov and ennigsen his hief oftaff the presence of confidential representatives of the mperor andthese transfers a more than usually complicated play of parties wasgoing on among the staff of the army  was undermining   wasundermining  and so on in all possible combinations and permutationsn all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conductof the war which all these men believed they were directing but thisaffair of the war went on independently of them as it had to go thatis never in the way people devised but flowing always from theessential attitude of the masses nly in the highest spheres did allthese schemes crossings and interminglings appear to be a truereflection of what had to happenrince ichael larionovich wrote the mperor on the second of ctoberin a letter that reached utuzov after the battle at arutino inceeptember  oscow has been in the hands of the enemy our last reportswere written on the twentieth and during all this time not only has noaction been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancientcapital but according to your last report you have even retreatedfarther erpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and ulawith its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army is in danger romeneral intzingerodes reports  see that an enemy corps of tenthousand men is moving on the etersburg road nother corps of severalthousand men is moving on mitrov  third has advanced along theladimir road and a fourth rather considerable detachment is stationedbetween uza and ozhaysk apoleon himself was in oscow as late as thetwentyfifth n view of all this information when the enemy hasscattered his forces in large detachments and with apoleon and hisuards in oscow is it possible that the enemys forces confronting youare so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive n thecontrary he is probably pursuing you with detachments or at most withan army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you t would seemthat availing yourself of these circumstances you might advantageouslyattack a weaker one and annihilate him or at least oblige him toretreat retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces nowoccupied by the enemy and thereby averting danger from ula and othertowns in the interior ou will be responsible if the enemy is able todirect a force of any size against etersburg to threaten this capitalin which it has not been possible to retain many troops for with thearmy entrusted to you and acting with resolution and energy you haveample means to avert this fresh calamity emember that you have stillto answer to our offended country for the loss of oscow ou haveexperienced my readiness to reward you hat readiness will not weakenin me but  and ussia have a right to expect from you all the zealfirmness and success which your intellect military talent and thecourage of the troops you command justify us in expectingut by the time this letter which proved that the real relation of theforces had already made itself felt in etersburg was dispatchedutuzov

important orderentrusted to him t was already past eight oclock e dismounted andwent up into the porch of a large country house which had remainedintact between the ussian and rench forces n the refreshment roomand the hall footmen were bustling about with wine and viands roupsof singers stood outside the windows he officer was admitted andimmediately saw all the chief generals of the army together and amongthem rmolovs big imposing figure hey all had their coats unbuttonedand were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faceslaughing loudly n the middle of the room a short handsome general witha red face was dancing the trepak with much spirit and agilitya ha ha ravo icholas vanych a ha hahe officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a momenthe was doubly to blame and he would have preferred to wait but one ofthe generals espied him and hearing what he had come about informedrmolovrmolov came forward with a frown on his face and hearing what theofficer had to say took the papers from him without a wordou think he went off just by chance said a comrade who was on thestaff that evening to the officer of the orse uards referring tormolov t was a trick t was done on purpose to get onovnitsyn intotrouble oull see what a mess therell be tomorrow ext day the decrepit utuzov having given orders to be called earlysaid his prayers dressed and with an unpleasant consciousness ofhaving to direct a battle he did not approve of got into his calecheand drove from etashovka a village three and a half miles fromarutino to the place where the attacking columns were to meet e satin the caleche dozing and waking up by turns and listening for anysound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begunut all was still quiet  damp dull autumn morning was just dawning napproaching arutino utuzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses towater across the road along which he was driving utuzov looked at themsearchingly stopped his carriage and inquired what regiment theybelonged to hey belonged to a column that should have been far infront and in ambush long before then t may be a mistake thought theold commanderinchief ut a little further on he saw infantryregiments with their arms piled and the soldiers only partly dressedeating their rye porridge and carrying fuel e sent for an officer heofficer reported that no order to advance had been receivedow ot rec utuzov began but checked himself immediately andsent for a senior officer etting out of his caleche he waited withdrooping head and breathing heavily pacing silently up and down henykhen the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned appearedutuzov went purple in the face not because that officer was to blamefor the mistake but because he was an object of sufficient importancefor him to vent his wrath on rembling and panting the old man fellinto that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on theground and he fell upon ykhen threatening him with his handsshouting and loading him with gross abuse nother man aptain rozinwho happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame suffered thesame fatehat sort of another blackguard are you ll have you shotcoundrels yelled utuzov in a hoarse voice waving his arms andreelinge was suffering physically e the commanderinchief a ereneighness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever hadin ussia to be placed in this positionmade the laughingstock of thewhole army  neednt have been in such a hurry to pray about today orhave kept awake thinking everything over all night thought he tohimself hen  was a chit of an officer no one would have dared tomock me so and now e was in a state of physical suffering as iffrom corporal punishment and could not avoid expressing it by cries ofanger and distress ut his strength soon began to fail him and lookingabout him conscious of having said much that was amiss he again gotinto his caleche and drove back in silenceis wrath once expended did not return and blinking feebly helistened to excuses and selfjustifications rmolov did not come to seehim till the next day and to the insistence of ennigsen onovnitsynand oll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed nextday nd once more utuzov had to consent ext day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the eveningand advanced during the night t was an autumn night with dark purpleclouds but no rain he ground was damp but not muddy and the troopsadvanced noiselessly only occasionally a jingling of the artillerycould be faintly heard he men were forbidden to talk out loud tosmoke their pipes or to strike a light and they tried to prevent theirhorses neighing he secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm andthey marched gaily ome columns supposing they had reached theirdestination halted piled arms and settled down on the cold groundbut the majority marched all night and arrived at places where theyevidently should not have beennly ount rlovenisov with his ossacks the least importantdetachment of all got to his appointed place at the right time hisdetachment halted at the outskirts of a forest on the path leading fromthe village of tromilova to mitrovskoward dawn ount rlovenisov who had dozed off was awakened by adeserter from the rench army being brought to him his was a olishsergeant of oniatowskis corps who explained in olish that he hadcome over because he had been slighted in the service that he oughtlong ago to have been made an officer that he was braver than any ofthem and so he had left them and wished to pay them out e said thaturat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were andthat if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he wouldcapture him alive ount rlovenisov consulted his fellow officershe offer was too tempting to be refused veryone volunteered to go andeverybody advised making the attempt fter much disputing and arguingajoreneral rekov with two ossack regiments decided to go with theolish sergeantow remember said ount rlovenisov to the sergeant at partingif you have been lying ll have you hanged like a dog but if itstrue you shall have a hundred gold piecesithout replying the sergeant with a resolute air mounted and rodeaway with rekov whose men had quickly assembled hey disappeared intothe forest and ount rlovenisov having seen rekov off returnedshivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what hehad undertaken on his own responsibility and began looking at the enemycamp now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dyingcampfires ur columns ought to have begun to appear on an opendeclivity to his right e looked in that direction but though thecolumns would have been visible quite far off they were not to be seent seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the renchcamp and his keensighted adjutant confirmed thish it is really too late said ount rlov looking at the camps often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before oureyes it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that thesergeant was an impostor that he had lied and that the whole ussianattack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments which hewould lead away heaven only knew where ow could one capture acommanderinchief from among such a mass of troops am sure that rascal was lying said the counthey can still be called back said one of his suite who like ountrlov felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemyscamph eally what do you think hould we let them go on or notill you have them fetched backetch them back fetch them back said ount rlov with suddendetermination looking at his watch t will be too late t is quitelightnd the adjutant galloped through the forest after rekov hen rekovreturned ount rlovenisov excited both by the abandoned attempt andby vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear aswell as by the proximity of the enemy resolved to advance ll his menfelt the same excitementount he commanded in a whisper he men took their places andcrossed themselves orward with ods aidurrahahah reverberated in the forest and the ossack companiestrailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured outof a sack dashed gaily across the brook toward the campne desperate frightened yell from the first rench soldier who saw theossacks and all who were in the camp undressed and only just wakingup ran off in all directions abandoning cannons muskets and horsesad the ossacks pursued the rench without heeding what was behind andaround them they would have captured urat and everything there hatwas what the officers desired ut it was impossible to make theossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners one of themlistened to orders ifteen hundred prisoners and thirtyeight guns weretaken on the spot besides standards and what seemed most important tothe ossacks horses saddles horsecloths and the like ll this hadto be dealt with the prisoners and guns secured the booty dividednotwithout some shouting and even a little fighting among themselvesandit was on this that the ossacks all busied themselveshe rench not being farther pursued began to recover themselves theyformed into detachments and began firing rlovenisov still waitingfor the other columns to arrive advanced no furthereantime according to the dispositions which said that the irstolumn will march and so on the infantry of the belated columnscommanded by ennigsen and directed by oll had started in due orderand as always happens had got somewhere but not to their appointedplaces s always happens the men starting cheerfully began to haltmurmurs were heard there was a sense of confusion and finally abackward movement djutants and generals galloped about shouted grewangry quarreled said they had come quite wrong and were late gavevent to a little abuse and at last gave it all up and went forwardsimply to get somewhere e shall get somewhere or other nd they didindeed get somewhere though not to their right places a few eventuallyeven got to their right place but too late to be of any use and only intime to be fired at oll who in this battle played the part ofeyrother at usterlitz galloped assiduously from place to placefinding everything upside down everywhere hus he stumbled on

delayconfusion and crosspurposes fell into a rage to everybodys surpriseand quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable thingsto oll prefer not to take lessons from anyone but  can die with my men aswell as anybody he said and advanced with a single divisionoming out onto a field under the enemys fire this brave general wentstraight ahead leading his men under fire without considering in hisagitation whether going into action now with a single division wouldbe of any use or no anger cannon balls and bullets were just what heneeded in his angry mood ne of the first bullets killed him and otherbullets killed many of his men nd his division remained under fire forsome time quite uselessly eanwhile another column was to have attacked the rench from the frontbut utuzov accompanied that column e well knew that nothing butconfusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will and asfar as was in his power held the troops back e did not advancee rode silently on his small gray horse indolently answeringsuggestions that they should attackhe word attack is always on your tongue but you dont see that we areunable to execute complicated maneuvers said he to iloradovich whoasked permission to advancee couldnt take urat prisoner this morning or get to the place intime and nothing can be done now he replied to someone elsehen utuzov was informed that at the rench rearwhere according tothe reports of the ossacks there had previously been nobodythere werenow two battalions of oles he gave a sidelong glance at rmolov whowas behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous dayou see hey are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds butas soon as one gets to business nothing is ready and the enemyforewarned takes measures accordinglyrmolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these wordse understood that for him the storm had blown over and that utuzovwould content himself with that hintes having a little fun at my expense said rmolov softly nudgingwith his knee aevski who was at his sideoon after this rmolov moved up to utuzov and respectfully remarkedt is not too late yet your ighnessthe enemy has not gone awayifyou were to order an attack f not the uards will not so much as seea little smokeutuzov did not reply but when they reported to him that urats troopswere in retreat he ordered an advance though at every hundred paces hehalted for three quarters of an hourhe whole battle consisted in what rlovenisovs ossacks had donethe rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselesslyn consequence of this battle utuzov received a diamond decoration andennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles others alsoreceived pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various gradesand following the battle fresh changes were made in the staffhats how everything is done with us all topsyturvy said theussian officers and generals after the arutino battle letting it beunderstood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that weourselves should not have done so just as people speak today utpeople who talk like that either do not know what they are talking aboutor deliberately deceive themselves o battlearutino orodino orusterlitztakes place as those who planned it anticipated hat is anessential condition countless number of free forces for nowhere is man freer than duringa battle where it is a question of life and death influence the coursetaken by the fight and that course never can be known in advance andnever coincides with the direction of any one forcef many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a givenbody the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of thoseforces but will always be a meanwhat in mechanics is represented bythe diagonal of a parallelogram of forcesf in the descriptions given by historians especially rench ones wefind their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previouslyformed plans the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptionsare falsehe battle of arutino obviously did not attain the aim oll had inviewto lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by thedispositions nor that which ount rlovenisov may have had in viewto take urat prisoner nor the result of immediately destroying thewhole corps which ennigsen and others may have had in view nor theaim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himselfnor that of the ossack who wanted more booty than he got and so onut if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all theussians of that day desiredto drive the rench out of ussia anddestroy their armyit is quite clear that the battle of arutino justbecause of its incongruities was exactly what was wanted at that stageof the campaign t would be difficult and even impossible to imagineany result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle ith aminimum of effort and insignificant losses despite the greatestconfusion the most important results of the whole campaign wereattained the transition from retreat to advance an exposure of theweakness of the rench and the administration of that shock whichapoleons army had only awaited to begin its flight apoleon enters oscow after the brilliant victory de la oskowa therecan be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in thehands of the rench he ussians retreat and abandon their ancientcapital oscow abounding in provisions arms munitions andincalculable wealth is in apoleons hands he ussian army only halfthe strength of the rench does not make a single attempt to attack fora whole month apoleons position is most brilliant e can either fallon the ussian army with double its strength and destroy it negotiatean advantageous peace or in case of a refusal make a menacing move onetersburg or even in the case of a reverse return to molensk orilna or remain in oscow in short no special genius would seem to berequired to retain the brilliant position the rench held at that timeor that only very simple and easy steps were necessary not to allowthe troops to loot to prepare winter clothingof which there wassufficient in oscow for the whole armyand methodically to collect theprovisions of which according to the rench historians there wereenough in oscow to supply the whole army for six months et apoleonthat greatest of all geniuses who the historians declare had control ofthe army took none of these stepse not merely did nothing of the kind but on the contrary he used hispower to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open tohim f all that apoleon might have done wintering in oscowadvancing on etersburg or on izhniovgorod or retiring by a morenortherly or more southerly route say by the road utuzov afterwardstook nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what heactually did e remained in oscow till ctober letting the troopsplunder the city then hesitating whether to leave a garrison behindhim he quitted oscow approached utuzov without joining battleturned to the right and reached aloaroslavets again withoutattempting to break through and take the road utuzov took but retiringinstead to ozhaysk along the devastated molensk road othing morestupid than that could have been devised or more disastrous for thearmy as the sequel showed ad apoleons aim been to destroy his armythe most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series ofactions that would so completely have accomplished that purposeindependently of anything the ussian army might doapoleon the man of genius did this ut to say that he destroyed hisarmy because he wished to or because he was very stupid would be asunjust as to say that he had brought his troops to oscow because hewished to and because he was very clever and a geniusn both cases his personal activity having no more force than thepersonal activity of any soldier merely coincided with the laws thatguided the eventhe historians quite falsely represent apoleons faculties as havingweakened in oscow and do so only because the results did not justifyhis actions e employed all his ability and strength to do the best hecould for himself and his army as he had done previously and as he didsubsequently in  is activity at that time was no less astoundingthan it was in gypt in taly in ustria and in russia e do notknow for certain in how far his genius was genuine in gyptwhere fortycenturies looked down upon his grandeurfor his great exploits thereare all told us by renchmen e cannot accurately estimate his geniusin ustria or russia for we have to draw our information from renchor erman sources and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corpswithout fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline ermansto recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on inermany ut we thank od have no need to recognize his genius inorder to hide our shame e have paid for the right to look at thematter plainly and simply and we will not abandon that rightis activity in oscow was as amazing and as full of genius aselsewhere rder after order and plan after plan were issued by him fromthe time he entered oscow till the time he left it he absence ofcitizens and of a deputation and even the burning of oscow did notdisconcert him e did not lose sight either of the welfare of his armyor of the

as wellas the false paper money which flooded oscow lost its value herench collecting booty cared only for gold ot only was the papermoney valueless which apoleon so graciously distributed to theunfortunate but even silver lost its value in relation to goldut the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders givenby the authorities at that time was apoleons attempt to stop

run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by thecapture of transport trains on the molensk road and by the battle ofarutino he news of that battle of arutino unexpectedly received byapoleon at a review evoked in him a desire to punish the ussianshiers says and he issued the order for departure which the wholearmy was demandingleeing from oscow the soldiers took with them everything they hadstolen apoleon too carried away his own personal tresor but onseeing the baggage trains that impeded the army he was hiers sayshorrorstruck nd yet with his experience of war he did not order allthe superfluous vehicles to be burned as he had done with those of acertain marshal when approaching oscow e gazed at the caleches andcarriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a verygood thing as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions thesick and the woundedhe plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal whichfeels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing o study theskillful tactics and aims of apoleon and his army from the time itentered oscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leapsand shudders of a mortally wounded

in a homely way a skullcap onhis head and a short pipe in his mouth came from behind a corner ofthe shed and approached ierre with a friendly winkhat sunshine onsieur iril heir name for ierre h ust likespringnd the corporal leaned against the door and offered ierre his pipethough whenever he offered it ierre always declined ito be on the march in such weather he beganierre inquired what was being said about leaving and the corporal toldhim that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be anorder about the prisoners that day okolov one of the soldiers in theshed with ierre was dying and ierre told the corporal that somethingshould be done about him he corporal replied that ierre need notworry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital andarrangements would be made for the sick and that in general everythingthat could happen had been foreseen by the authoritiesesides onsieur iril you have only to say a word to the captainyou know e is a man who never forgets anything peak to the captainwhen he makes his round he will do anything for youhe captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with ierreand showed him all sorts of favorsou

me he wont get a refusal hen one has studied yousee one likes education and wellbred people t is for your sake mention it onsieur iril he other day if it had not been for youthat affair would have ended illnd after chatting a while longer the corporal went away he affairhe had alluded to had happened a few days beforea fight between theprisoners and the rench soldiers in which ierre had succeeded inpacifying his comrades ome of the prisoners who had heard ierretalking to the corporal immediately asked what the renchman had saidhile ierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leavingoscow a thin sallow tattered rench soldier came up to the door ofthe shed apidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by wayof greeting he asked ierre whether the soldier latoche to whom he hadgiven a shirt to sew was in that shed week before the rench had had boot leather and linen issued to themwhich they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots andshirts for themeady ready dear fellow said arataev coming out with a neatlyfolded shirtarataev on account of the warm weather and for convenience at workwas wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot ishair was bound round workman fashion with a wisp of limetree bastand his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever promise is own brother to performance  said riday and here it isready said laton smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewnhe renchman glanced around uneasily and then as if overcoming hishesitation rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt e had along greasy flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow thin barebody but no shirt e was evidently afraid the prisoners looking onwould laugh at him and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly oneof the prisoners said a wordee it fits well laton kept repeating pulling the shirt straighthe renchman having pushed his head and hands through without raisinghis eyes looked down at the shirt and examined the seamsou see dear man this is not a sewing shop and  had no propertools and as they say one needs a tool even to kill a louse saidlaton with one of his round smiles obviously pleased with his workts good quite good thank you said the renchman in rench butthere must be some linen left overt will fit better still when it sets to your body said arataevstill admiring his handiwork oull be nice and comfortablehanks thanks old fellow ut the bits left over said therenchman again and smiled e took out an assignation ruble note andgave it to arataev ut give me the pieces that are overierre saw that laton did not want to understand what the renchman wassaying and he looked on without interfering arataev thanked therenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work he renchmaninsisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and askedierre to translate what he saidhat does he want the bits for said arataev heyd make fine legbands for us ell never mindnd arataev with a suddenly changed and saddened expression took asmall bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to therenchman without looking at him h dear muttered arataev and wentaway he renchman looked at the linen considered for a moment thenlooked inquiringly at ierre and as if ierres look had told himsomething suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voicelatoche h latoche eep them yourself nd handing back the oddbits he turned and went outhere look at that said arataev swaying his head eople saidthey were not hristians but they too have souls ts what the oldfolk used to say  sweating hands an open hand a dry hands closees naked but yet hes given it backarataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at thepiecesut theyll make grand leg bands dear friend he said and went backinto the shed our weeks had passed since ierre had been taken prisoner and thoughthe rench had offered to move him from the mens to the officers shedhe had stayed in the shed where he was first putn burned and devastated oscow ierre experienced almost the extremelimits of privation a man can endure but thanks to his physicalstrength and health of which he had till then been unconscious andthanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually thatit was impossible to say when they began he endured his position notonly lightly but joyfully nd just at this time he obtained thetranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reache had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind thatinner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battleof orodino e had sought it in philanthropy in reemasonry in thedissipations of town life in wine in heroic feats of selfsacrificeand in romantic love for atasha he had sought it by reasoningand allthese quests and experiments had failed him nd now without thinkingabout it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through thehorror of death through privation and through what he recognized inarataevhose dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as itwere forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitatingthoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important t did notnow occur to him to think of ussia or the war or politics orapoleon t was plain to him that all these things were no business ofhis and that he was not called on to judge concerning them andtherefore could not do so ussia and summer weather are not boundtogether he thought repeating words of arataevs which he foundstrangely consoling is intention of killing apoleon and hiscalculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the pocalypse nowseemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous is anger with his wifeand anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merelytrivial but even amusing hat concern was it of his that somewhere orother that woman was leading the life she preferred hat did it matterto anybody and especially to him whether or not they found out thattheir prisoners name was ount ezukhove now often remembered his conversation with rince ndrew and quiteagreed with him though he understood rince ndrews thoughts somewhatdifferently rince ndrew had thought and said that happiness couldonly be negative but had said it with a shade of bitterness and ironyas though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness isimplanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied ut ierrebelieved it without any mental reservation he absence of sufferingthe satisfaction of ones needs and consequent freedom in the choice ofones occupation that is of ones way of life now seemed to ierre tobe indubitably mans highest happiness ere and now for the first timehe fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eatdrinking when he wanted to drink sleeping when he wanted to sleep ofwarmth when he was cold of talking to a fellow man when he wished totalk and to hear a human voice he satisfaction of ones needsgoodfood cleanliness and freedomnow that he was deprived of all thisseemed to ierre to constitute perfect happiness and the choice ofoccupation that is of his way of lifenow that that was sorestrictedseemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that asuperfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying onesneeds while great freedom in the choice of occupationsuch freedom ashis wealth his education and his social position had given him in hisown lifeis just what makes the choice of occupation insolublydifficult and destroys the desire and possibility of having anoccupationll ierres daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free etsubsequently and for the rest of his life he thought and spoke withenthusiasm of that month of captivity of those irrecoverable strongjoyful sensations and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and innerfreedom which he experienced only during those weekshen on the first day he got up early went out of the shed at dawn andsaw the cupolas and crosses of the ew onvent of the irgin still darkat first the hoarfrost on the dusty grass the parrow ills and thewooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distancewhen he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of thecrows flying from oscow across the field and when afterwards lightgleamed from the east and the suns rim appeared solemnly from behind acloud and the cupolas and crosses the hoarfrost the distance and theriver all began to sparkle in the glad lightierre felt a new joy andstrength in life such as he had never before known nd this not onlystayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment but even grew instrength as the hardships of his position increasedhat feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was stillfurther strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisonersformed of him soon after his arrival at the shed ith his knowledge oflanguages the respect shown him by the rench his simplicity hisreadiness to give anything asked of him he received the allowance ofthree rubles a week made to officers with his strength which heshowed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut hisgentleness to his companions and his capacity for sitting still andthinking without doing anything which seemed to them incomprehensiblehe appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being he veryqualities that had been a hindrance if not actually harmful to him inthe world he had lived inhis strength his disdain for the comforts oflife his absentmindedness and simplicityhere among these people gavehim almost the status of a hero nd ierre felt that their opinionplaced responsibilities upon him he rench evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventhof ctober kitchens and sheds were dismantled carts loaded and troopsand baggage trains startedt seven in the morning a rench convoy in marching trim wearing shakosand carrying muskets knapsacks and enormous sacks stood in front ofthe sheds and animated rench talk mingled with curses sounded allalong the linesn the shed everyone was ready dressed belted shod and only awaitedthe order to start he sick soldier okolov pale and thin with darkshadows round his eyes alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressedis eyes prominent from the emaciation of his face gazed inquiringlyat his comrades who were paying no attention to him and he moanedregularly and quietly t was evidently not so much his sufferings thatcaused him to moan he had dysentery as his fear and grief at beingleft aloneierre girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes arataev hadmade for him from some leather a rench soldier had torn off a tea chestand brought to have his boots mended with went up to the sick man andsquatted down beside himou know okolov they are not all going away hey have a hospitalhere ou may be better off than we others said ierre ord h it will be the death of me  ord moaned the man in alouder voicell go and ask them again directly said ierre rising and going tothe door of the shedust as ierre reached the door the corporal who had offered him a pipethe day before came up to it with two soldiers he corporal andsoldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metalstraps and these changed their familiar faceshe corporal came according to orders to shut the door he prisonershad to be counted before being let outorporal what will they do with the sick man ierre beganut even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal heknew or a stranger so unlike himself did the corporal seem at thatmoment oreover just as ierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drumswas suddenly heard from both sides he corporal frowned at ierreswords and uttering some meaningless oaths slammed the door he shedbecame semidark and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drownedthe sick mans groanshere it is t again said ierre to himself and aninvoluntary shudder ran down his spine n the corporals changed facein the sound of his voice in the stirring and deafening noise of thedrums he recognized that mysterious callous force which compelledpeople against their will to kill their fellow menthat force theeffect of which he had witnessed during the executions o fear or totry to escape that force to address entreaties or exhortations to thosewho served as its tools was useless ierre knew this now ne had towait and endure e did not again go to the sick man nor turn to lookat him but stood frowning by the door of the huthen that door was opened and the prisoners crowding against oneanother like a flock of sheep squeezed into the exit ierre pushed hisway forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal hadassured him was ready to do anything for him he captain was also inmarching kit and on his cold face appeared that same it which ierrehad recognized in the corporals words and in the roll of the drumsass on pass on the captain reiterated frowning sternly andlooking at the prisoners who thronged past himierre went up to him though he knew his attempt would be vainhat now the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizingierreierre told him about the sick manell manage to walk devil take him said the captain ass on passon he continued without looking at ierreut he is dying ierre again begane so good shouted the captain frowning angrilyramdadadam damdam rattled the drums and ierre understoodthat this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that itwas now useless to say any morehe officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to marchin front here were about thirty officers with ierre among them andabout three hundred menhe officers who had come from the other sheds were all strangers toierre and much better dressed than he hey looked at him and at hisshoes mistrustfully as at an alien ot far from him walked a fat majorwith a sallow bloated angry face who was wearing a azan dressinggown tied round with a towel and who evidently enjoyed the respect ofhis fellow prisoners e kept one hand in which he clasped his tobaccopouch inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of hispipe firmly with the other anting and puffing the major grumbled andgrowled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and thatthey were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were allsurprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised atnother a thin little officer was speaking to everyone conjecturingwhere they were now being taken and how far they would get that day nofficial in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round fromside to side and gazed at the ruins of oscow loudly announcing hisobservations as to what had been burned down and what this or that partof the city was that they could see  third officer who by his accentwas a ole disputed with the commissariat officer arguing that he wasmistaken in his identification of the different wards of oscowhat are you disputing about said the major angrily hat does itmatter whether it is t icholas or t lasius ou see its burneddown and theres an end of it hat

gazed on the charred ruins ll beyond theriver and ubova and in the remlin ust look heres not half ofit left es  told youthe whole quarter beyond the river and so itisell you know its burned so whats the use of talking said themajors they passed near a church in the hamovniki one of the few unburnedquarters of oscow the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to oneside and exclamations of horror and disgust were heardh the villains hat heathens es dead dead so he is ndsmeared with somethingierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked theseexclamations and dimly made out

were gazing atthe dead man hrough the cross streets of the hamovniki quarter the prisonersmarched followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagonsbelonging to that escort but when they reached the supply stores theycame among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled withprivate vehiclest the bridge they all halted waiting for those in front to get acrossrom the bridge

on and from all sides vehicles and mencrowded closer and closer together hey advanced the few hundred pacesthat separated the bridge from the aluga road taking more than an hourto do so and came out upon the square where the streets of theransmoskva ward and the aluga road converge and the prisoners jammedclose together had to stand for some hours at that crossway rom allsides like the roar of the sea were heard the rattle of wheels thetramp of feet and incessant shouts of anger and abuse ierre stoodpressed against the wall of a charred house listening to that noisewhich mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drumso get a better view several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall ofthe halfburned house against which ierre was leaninghat crowds ust look at the crowds heyve

over the heads of the others what so attracted theircuriosity n three carriages involved among the munition carts closelysqueezed together sat women with rouged faces dressed in glaringcolors who were shouting something in shrill voicesrom the moment ierre had recognized the appearance of the mysteriousforce nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful neither the corpsesmeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burnedruins of oscow ll that he now witnessed scarcely made an impressionon himas if his soul making ready for a hard struggle refused toreceive impressions that might weaken ithe womens vehicles drove by ehind them came more carts soldierswagons soldiers gun carriages carriages soldiers ammunition cartsmore soldiers and now and then womenierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movementll these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisiblepower uring the hour ierre watched them they all came flowing fromthe different streets with one and the same desire to get on quicklythey all jostled one another began to grow angry and to fight whiteteeth gleamed brows frowned ever the same words of abuse flew fromside to side and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute andcoldly cruel expression that had struck ierre that morning on thecorporals face when the drums were beatingt was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escortcollected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in amongthe baggage trains and the prisoners hemmed in on all sides emergedonto the aluga roadhey marched very quickly without resting and halted only when the sunbegan to set he baggage carts drew up close together and the men beganto prepare for their nights rest hey all appeared angry anddissatisfied or a long time oaths angry shouts and fighting couldbe heard from all sides  carriage that followed the escort ran intoone of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole everalsoldiers ran toward the cart from different sides some beat thecarriage horses on their heads turning them aside others fought amongthemselves and ierre saw that one erman was badly wounded on the headby a swordt seemed that all these men now that they had stopped amid fields inthe chill dusk of the autumn evening experienced one and the samefeeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push onthat had seized them at the start nce at a standstill they all seemedto understand that they did not yet know where they were going and thatmuch that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journeyuring this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than theyhad done at the start t was here that the prisoners for the first timereceived horseflesh for their meat rationrom the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed likepersonal spite against each of the prisoners in unexpected contrast totheir former friendly relationshis spite increased still more when on calling over the roll ofprisoners it was found that in the bustle of leaving oscow one ussiansoldier who had pretended to suffer from colic had escaped ierre sawa renchman beat a ussian soldier cruelly for straying too far from theroad and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to courtmartial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of theussian o the noncommissioned officers excuse that the prisoner wasill and could not walk the officer replied that the order was to shootthose who lagged behind ierre felt that that fatal force which hadcrushed him during the executions but which he had not felt during hisimprisonment now again controlled his existence t was terrible buthe felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crushhim there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independentof ite ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with hiscomradeseither ierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen inoscow or of the roughness of their treatment by the rench or of theorder to shoot them which had been announced to them s if in reactionagainst the worsening of their position they were all particularlyanimated and gay hey spoke of personal reminiscences of amusingscenes they had witnessed during the campaign and avoided all talk oftheir present situationhe sun had set long since right stars shone out here and there in thesky  red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from therising full moon and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the grayhaze t grew light he evening was ending but the night had not yetcome ierre got up and left his new companions crossing between thecampfires to the other side of the road where he had been told thecommon soldier prisoners were stationed e wanted to talk to them nthe road he was stopped by a rench sentinel who ordered him backierre turned back not to his companions by the campfire but to anunharnessed cart where there was nobody ucking his legs under him anddropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of thecart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought uddenly heburst out into a fit of his broad goodnatured laughter so loud thatmen from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange andevidently solitary laughter could meanahaha laughed ierre nd he said aloud to himself he soldierdid not let me pass hey took me and shut me up hey hold me captivehat me e y immortal soul ahaha ahaha and he laughedtill tears started to his eyes man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing atall by himself ierre stopped laughing got up went farther away fromthe inquisitive man and looked around himhe huge endless bivouac that had previously resounded with thecrackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet thered campfires were growing paler and dying down igh up in the lightsky hung the full moon orests and fields beyond the camp unseenbefore were now visible in the distance nd farther still beyondthose forests and fields the bright oscillating limitless distancelured one to itself ierre glanced up at the sky and the twinklingstars in its faraway depths nd all that is me all that is within meand it is all  thought ierre nd they caught all that and put itinto a shed boarded up with planks e smiled and went and lay down tosleep beside his companions n the early days of ctober another envoy came to utuzov with a letterfrom apoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from oscow thoughapoleon was already not far from utuzov on the old aluga roadutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerlybrought by auriston saying that there could be no question of peaceoon after that a report was received from orokhovs guerrilladetachment operating to the left of arutino that troops of roussiersdivision had been seen at orminsk and that being separated from therest of the rench army they might easily be destroyed he soldiers andofficers again demanded action enerals on the staff excited by thememory of the easy victory at arutino urged utuzov to carry outorokhovs suggestion utuzov did not consider any offensive necessaryhe result was a compromise which was inevitable a small detachment wassent to orminsk to attack roussiery a strange coincidence this task which turned out to be a mostdifficult and important one was entrusted to okhturovthat samemodest little okhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing upplans of battles dashing about in front of regiments showering crosseson batteries and so on and who was thought to be and was spoken of asundecided and undiscerningbut whom we find commanding wherever theposition was most difficult all through the ussorench wars fromusterlitz to the year  t usterlitz he remained last at theugezd dam rallying the regiments saving what was possible when allwere flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rearguard ll with fever he went to molensk with twenty thousand men todefend the town against apoleons whole army n molensk at thealakhov ate he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before hewas awakened by the bombardment of the townand molensk held out allday long t the battle of orodino when agration was killed and ninetenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of therench artillery fire was directed against it the man sent there wasthis same irresolute and undiscerning okhturovutuzov hastening torectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first ndthe quiet little okhturov rode thither and orodino became thegreatest glory of the ussian army any heroes have been described tous in verse and prose but of okhturov scarcely a word has been saidt was okhturov again whom they sent to orminsk and from there toaloaroslavets the place where the last battle with the rench wasfought and where the obvious disintegration of the rench army beganand we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of thecampaign but of okhturov nothing or very little is said and thatdubiously nd this silence about okhturov is the clearest testimony tohis meritt is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of amachine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance andis interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its mostimportant part he man who does not understand the construction of themachine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel whichrevolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine andnot the shaving which merely harms and hinders the workingn the tenth of ctober when okhturov had gone halfway to orminsk andstopped at the village of ristovo preparing faithfully to execute theorders he had received the whole rench army having in its convulsivemovement reached urats position apparently in order to give battlesuddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new alugaroad and began to enter orminsk where only roussier had been tillthen t that time okhturov had under his command besides orokhovsdetachment the two small guerrilla detachments of igner and eslavinn the evening of ctober  eslavin came to the ristovo headquarterswith a rench guardsman he had captured he prisoner said that thetroops that had entered orminsk that day were the vanguard of the wholearmy that apoleon was there and the whole army had left oscow fourdays previously hat same evening a house serf who had come fromorovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town omeossacks of okhturovs detachment reported having sighted the renchuards marching along the road to orovsk rom all these reports it wasevident that where they had expected to meet a single division there wasnow the whole rench army marching from oscow in an unexpecteddirectionalong the aluga road okhturov was unwilling to undertakeany action as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do e hadbeen ordered to attack orminsk ut only roussier had been there atthat time and now the whole rench army was there rmolov wished to acton his own judgment but okhturov insisted that he must have utuzovsinstructions o it was decided to send a dispatch to the staffor this purpose a capable officer olkhovitinov was chosen who wasto explain the whole affair by word of mouth besides delivering awritten report oward midnight olkhovitinov having received thedispatch and verbal instructions galloped off to the eneral taffaccompanied by a ossack with spare horses t was a warm dark autumn night

appearanceell what is it rom whom he asked immediately but without hurryblinking at the lighthile listening to the officers report onovnitsyn broke the seal andread the dispatch ardly had he done so before he lowered his legs intheir woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on hisboots hen he took off his nightcap combed his hair over his templesand donned his capid you get here quickly et us go to his ighnessonovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of greatimportance and that no time must be lost e did not consider or askhimself whether the news was good or bad hat did not interest him eregarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or hisreason but by something else here was within him a deep unexpressedconviction that all would be well but that one must not trust to thisand still less speak about it but must only attend to ones own worknd he did his work giving his whole strength to the tasketer etrovich onovnitsyn like okhturov seems to have been includedmerely for proprietys sake in the list of the socalled heroes of the arclays aevskis rmolovs latovs and iloradoviches ikeokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacityand information and like okhturov he never made plans of battle butwas always found where the situation was most difficult ince hisappointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door opengiving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up nbattle he was always under fire so that utuzov reproved him for it andfeared to send him to the front and like okhturov he was one of thoseunnoticed cogwheels that without clatter or noise constitute the mostessential part of the machineoming out of the hut into the damp dark night onovnitsyn frownedpartly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasantthought that occurred to him of how all that nest of influential men onthe staff would be stirred up by this news especially ennigsen whoever since arutino had been at daggers drawn with utuzov and how theywould make suggestions quarrel issue orders and rescind them ndthis premonition was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not behelpednd in fact oll to whom he went to communicate the news immediatelybegan to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters untilonovnitsyn who listened in weary silence reminded him that they mustgo to see his ighness utuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night e often fellasleep unexpectedly in the daytime but at night lying on his bedwithout undressing he generally remained awake thinkingo he lay now on his bed supporting his large heavy scarred head onhis plump hand with his one eye open meditating and peering into thedarknessince ennigsen who corresponded with the mperor and had moreinfluence than anyone else on the staff had begun to avoid him utuzovwas more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops beingobliged to take part in useless aggressive movements he lesson of thearutino battle and of the day before it which utuzov remembered withpain must he thought have some effect on others toohey must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensiveatience and time are my warriors my champions thought utuzov eknew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green t will fallof itself when ripe but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled the treeis harmed and your teeth are set on edge ike an experienced sportsmanhe knew that the beast was wounded and wounded as only the wholestrength of ussia could have wounded it but whether it was mortallywounded or not was still an undecided question ow by the fact ofauriston and arthelemi having been sent and by the reports of theguerrillas utuzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal ut heneeded further proofs and it was necessary to waithey want to run to see how they have wounded it ait and we shallsee ontinual maneuvers continual advances thought he hat fornly to distinguish themselves s if fighting were fun hey are likechildren from whom one cant get any sensible account of what hashappened because they all want to show how well they can fight utthats not what is needed nownd what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me t seems to themthat when they have thought of two or three contingencies heremembered the general plan sent him from etersburg they haveforeseen everything ut the contingencies are endlesshe undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at orodino wasmortal or not had hung over utuzovs head for a whole month n the onehand the rench had occupied oscow n the other utuzov felt assuredwith all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all theussians had put their whole strength must have been mortal ut in anycase proofs were needed he had waited a whole month for them and grewmore impatient the longer he waited ying on his bed during thosesleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generalsfor doing e imagined all sorts of possible contingencies just likethe younger men but with this difference that he saw thousands ofcontingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them helonger he thought the more contingencies presented themselves eimagined all sorts of movements of the apoleonic army as a whole or insectionsagainst etersburg or against him or to outflank him ethought too of the possibility which he feared most of all thatapoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in oscowawaiting him utuzov even imagined that apoleons army might turn backthrough edyn and ukhnov but the one thing he could not foresee waswhat happenedthe insane convulsive stampede of apoleons army duringits first eleven days after leaving oscow a stampede which madepossible what utuzov had not yet even dared to think ofthe completeextermination of the rench orokhovs report about roussiersdivision the guerrillas reports of distress in apoleons army rumorsof preparations for leaving oscow all confirmed the supposition thatthe rench army was beaten and preparing for flight ut these were onlysuppositions which seemed important to the younger men but not toutuzov ith his sixty years experience he knew what value to attachto rumors knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all newsso that it appears to confirm what they desire and he knew how readilyin such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary nd the more hedesired it the less he allowed himself to believe it his questionabsorbed all his mental powers ll else was to him only lifescustomary routine o such customary routine belonged his conversationswith the staff the letters he wrote from arutino to adame de taelthe reading of novels the distribution of awards his correspondencewith etersburg and so on ut the destruction of the rench which healone foresaw was his hearts one desiren the night of the eleventh of ctober he lay leaning on his arm

directionapoleons historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at arutinoand aloaroslavets and make conjectures as to what would havehappened had apoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southernprovincesut not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancinginto those southern provinces for the ussian army did not bar hisway the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army forthen already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin owcould that armywhich had found abundant supplies in oscow and hadtrampled them underfoot instead of keeping them and on arriving atmolensk had looted provisions instead of storing themhow could thatarmy recuperate in aluga province which was inhabited by ussians suchas those who lived in oscow and where fire had the same property ofconsuming what was set ablazehat army could not recover anywhere ince the battle of orodino andthe pillage of oscow it had borne within itself as it were thechemical elements of dissolutionhe members of what had once been an armyapoleon himself and all hissoldiers fledwithout knowing whither each concerned only to make hisescape as quickly as possible from this position of the hopelessness ofwhich they were all more or less vaguely consciouso it came about that at the council at aloaroslavets when thegenerals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions allmouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simpleminded soldierouton who speaking last said what they all felt that the one thingneedful was to get away as quickly as possible and no one not evenapoleon could say anything against that truth which they allrecognizedut though they all realized that it was necessary to get away therestill remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee nexternal shock was needed to overcome that shame and this shock came indue time t was what the rench called le hourra de lmpereurhe day after the council at aloaroslavets apoleon rode out early inthe morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and anescort on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of theprevious and of the impending battle ome ossacks on the prowl forbooty fell in with the mperor and very nearly captured him f theossacks did not capture apoleon then what saved him was the verything that was destroying the rench army the booty on which theossacks fell ere as at arutino they went after plunder leaving themen isregarding apoleon they rushed after the plunder and apoleonmanaged to escapehen les enfants du on might so easily have taken the mperor himselfin the midst of his army it was clear that there was nothing for it butto fly as fast as possible along the nearest familiar road apoleonwith his fortyyearold stomach understood that hint not feeling hisformer agility and boldness and under the influence of the fright theossacks had given him he at once agreed with outon and issued ordersas the historians tell usto retreat by the molensk roadhat apoleon agreed with outon and that the army retreated does notprove that apoleon caused it to retreat but that the forces whichinfluenced the whole army and directed it along the ozhaysk that isthe molensk road acted simultaneously on him also  man in motion always devises an aim for that motion o be able to goa thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at theend of those thousand miles ne must have the prospect of a promisedland to have the strength to movehe promised land for the rench during their advance had been oscowduring their retreat it was their native land ut that native land wastoo far off and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutelynecessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself oday shall get to a place twentyfive miles off where  shall rest and spendthe night and during the first days journey that resting placeeclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires ndthe impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowdor the rench retreating along the old molensk road the final goaltheir native landwas too remote and their immediate goal wasmolensk toward which all their desires and hopes enormouslyintensified in the mass urged them on t was not that they knew thatmuch food and fresh troops awaited them in molensk nor that they weretold so on the contrary their superior officers and apoleon himselfknew that provisions were scarce there but because this alone couldgive them strength to move on and endure their present privations oboth those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves andpushed on to molensk as to a promised landoming out onto the highroad the rench fled with surprising energy andunheardof rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on esides thecommon impulse which bound the whole crowd of rench into one mass andsupplied them with a certain energy there was another cause bindingthem togethertheir great numbers s with the physical law of gravitytheir enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself n theirhundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nationach of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisonerto escape from all this horror and misery but on the one hand the forceof this common attraction to molensk their goal drew each of them inthe same direction on the other hand an army corps could not surrenderto a company and though the rench availed themselves of everyconvenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on theslightest decent pretext such pretexts did not always occur heir verynumbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of thatpossibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for theussians to stop this movement to which the rench were directing alltheir energies eyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of thebody could hasten the process of decomposition lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously here is a certainlimit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow nthe contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snowbecomesf the ussian commanders utuzov alone understood this hen the flightof the rench army along the molensk road became well defined whatonovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of ctober beganto occur he superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves tocut off to seize to capture and to overthrow the rench and allclamored for actionutuzov alone used all his power and such power is very limited in thecase of any commanderinchief to prevent an attacke could not tell them what we say now hy fight why block the roadlosing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches hatis the use of that when a third of their army has melted away on theroad from oscow to yazma without any battle ut drawing from hisaged wisdom what they could understand he told them of the goldenbridge and they laughed at and slandered him flinging themselves onrending and exulting over the dying beastrmolov iloradovich latov and others in proximity to the renchnear yazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up tworench corps and by way of reporting their intention to utuzov theysent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelopend try as utuzov might to restrain the troops our men attackedtrying to bar the road nfantry regiments we are told advanced to theattack with music and with drums beating and killed and lost thousandsof menut they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the rench armyclosing up more firmly at the danger continued while steadily meltingaway to pursue its fatal path to molensk   he attle of orodino with the occupation of oscow that followed itand the flight of the rench without further conflicts is one of themost instructive phenomena in historyll historians agree that the external activity of states and nations intheir conflicts with one another is expressed in wars and that as adirect result of greater or less success in war the political strengthof states and nations increases or decreasestrange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperorhaving quarreled with another collects an army fights his enemysarmy gains a victory by killing three five or ten thousand men andsubjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions all thefacts of history as far as we know it confirm the truth of thestatement that the greater or lesser success of one army against anotheris the cause or at least an essential indication of an increase ordecrease in the strength of the nationeven though it is unintelligiblewhy the defeat of an armya hundredth part of a nationshould obligethat whole nation to submit n army gains a victory and at once therights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of thedefeated n army has suffered defeat and at once a people loses itsrights in proportion to the severity of the reverse and if its armysuffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugatedo according to history it has been found from the most ancient timesand so it is to our own day ll apoleons wars serve to confirm thisrule n proportion to the defeat of the ustrian army ustria loses itsrights and the rights and the strength of rance increase hevictories of the rench at ena and uerstadt destroy the independentexistence of russiaut then in  the rench gain a victory near oscow oscow istaken and after that with no further battles it is not ussia thatceases to exist but the rench army of six hundred thousand and thenapoleonic rance itself o strain the facts to fit the rules ofhistory to say that the field of battle at orodino remained in thehands of the ussians or that after oscow there were other battlesthat destroyed apoleons army is impossiblefter the rench victory at orodino there was no general engagement norany that were at all serious yet the rench army ceased to exist hatdoes this mean f it were an example taken from the history of hinawe might say that it was not an historic phenomenon which is thehistorians usual expedient when anything does not fit their standardsif the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small numberof troops took part we might treat it as an exception but this eventoccurred before our fathers eyes and for them it was a question of thelife or death of their fatherland and it happened in the greatest ofall known warshe period of the campaign of  from the battle of orodino to theexpulsion of the rench proved that the winning of a battle does notproduce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquestit proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not inthe conquerors nor even in armies and battles but in something elsehe rench historians describing the condition of the rench armybefore it left oscow affirm that all was in order in the rand rmyexcept the cavalry the artillery and the transportthere was noforage for the horses or the cattle hat was a misfortune no one couldremedy for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather thanlet the rench have ithe victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasantsarp and las who after the rench had evacuated oscow drove in theircarts to pillage the town and in general personally failed to manifestany heroic feelings and the whole innumerable multitude of suchpeasants did not bring their hay to oscow for the high price offeredthem but burned it insteadet us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiersaccording to all the rules of the art of fencing he fencing has goneon for some time suddenly one of the combatants feeling himselfwounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns hislife throws down his rapier and seizing the first cudgel that comes tohand begins to brandish it hen let us imagine that the combatant whoso sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end wasat the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and desiring toconceal the facts of the case insisted that he had gained his victorywith the rapier according to all the rules of art ne can imagine whatconfusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duelhe fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing wasthe rench army his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched upthe cudgel was the ussian people those who try to explain the matteraccording to the rules of fencing are the historians who have describedthe eventfter the burning of molensk a war began which did not follow anyprevious traditions of war he burning of towns and villages theretreats after battles the blow dealt at orodino and the renewedretreat the burning of oscow the capture of marauders the seizure oftransports and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rulesapoleon felt this and from the time he took up the correct fencingattitude in oscow and instead of his opponents rapier saw a cudgelraised above his head he did not cease to complain to utuzov and tothe mperor lexander that the war was being carried on contrary to allthe rulesas if there were any rules for killing people n spite ofthe complaints of the rench as to the nonobservance of the rules inspite of the fact that to some highly placed ussians it seemed ratherdisgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose enquarte or en tierce according to all the rules and to make an adroitthrust en prime and so onthe cudgel of the peoples war was liftedwith all its menacing and majestic strength and without consultinganyones tastes or rules and regardless of anything else it rose andfell with stupid simplicity but consistently and belabored the renchtill the whole invasion had perishednd it is well for a people who do notas the rench did in salute according to all the rules of art and presenting the hilt oftheir rapier gracefully and politely hand it to their magnanimousconqueror but at the moment of trial without asking what rules othershave adopted in similar cases simply and easily pick up the firstcudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling ofresentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt andcompassion ne of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the socalledlaws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressedtogether in a mass uch action always occurs in wars that take on anational character n such actions instead of two crowds opposing eachother the men disperse attack singly run away when attacked bystronger forces but again attack when opportunity offers his was doneby the guerrillas in pain by the mountain tribes in the aucasus andby the ussians in eople have called this kind of war guerrilla warfare and assume thatby so calling it they have explained its meaning ut such a war doesnot fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a wellknown ruleof tactics which is accepted as infallible hat rule says that anattacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than hisopponent at the moment of conflictuerrilla war always successful as history shows directly infringesthat rulehis contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumesthe strength of an army to be identical with its numbers ilitaryscience says that the more troops the greater the strength es grosbataillons ont toujours raison  arge battalions are always victoriousor military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanicsby reference to the mass only stating that momenta are equal or unequalto each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequalomentum quantity of motion is the product of mass and velocityn military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its massand some unknown xilitary science seeing in history innumerable instances of the factthat the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and thatsmall detachments defeat larger ones obscurely admits the existence ofthis unknown factor and tries to discover itnow in a geometricformation now in the equipment employed now and most usually in thegenius of the commanders ut the assignment of these various meaningsto the factor does not yield results which accord with the historicfactset it is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to gratifythe heroes of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime bycommanders in order to find this unknown quantityhat unknown quantity is the spirit of the army that is to say thegreater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the mencomposing an army quite independently of whether they are or are notfighting under the command of a genius in twoor threeline formationwith cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute en whowant to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageousconditions for fightinghe spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass givesthe resulting force o define and express the significance of thisunknown factorthe spirit of an armyis a problem for sciencehis problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute forthe unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomesapparentsuch as the commands of the general the equipment employedand so onmistaking these for the real significance of the factor andif we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being thegreater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger nly thenexpressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relativesignificance of this factor can we hope to define the unknownen men battalions or divisions fighting fifteen men battalions

andtherefore x  y onsequently xy   his equation does not giveus the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between twounknowns nd by bringing variously selected historic units battlescampaigns periods of war into such equations a series of numberscould be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might bediscoveredhe tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking andin smaller groups in retreat unconsciously confirms the truth that thestrength of an army depends on its spirit o lead men forward underfire more discipline obtainable only by movement in masses is neededthan is needed to resist attacks ut this rule which leaves out ofaccount the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is inparticularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise orfall in the spirit of the troops occurs as in all national warshe rench retreating in though according to tactics they shouldhave separated into detachments to defend themselvescongregated into amass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the massheld the army together he ussians on the contrary ought accordingto tactics to have attacked in mass but in fact they split up intosmall units because their spirit had so risen that separateindividuals without orders dealt blows at the rench without needingany compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships anddangers he socalled partisan war began with the entry of the rench intomolenskefore partisan warfare had been officially recognized by thegovernment thousands of enemy stragglers marauders and foragers hadbeen destroyed by the ossacks and the peasants who killed them off asinstinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death enis avydovwith his ussian instinct was the first to recognize the value of thisterrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military sciencedestroyed the rench and to him belongs the credit for taking the firststep toward regularizing

first period had passed when the partisans themselvesamazed at their own boldness feared every minute to be surrounded andcaptured by the rench and hid in the forests without unsaddlinghardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued y the endof ctober this kind of warfare had taken definite shape it had becomeclear to all what could be ventured against the rench and what couldnot ow only the commanders of detachments with staffs and movingaccording to rules at a distance from the rench still regarded manythings as impossible he small bands that had started their activitieslong before and had already observed the rench closely consideredthings possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dareto contemplate he ossacks and peasants who crept in among the renchnow considered everything possiblen ctober  enisov who was one of the irregulars was with hisgroup at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm ince early morning heand his party had been on the move ll day long he had been watchingfrom the forest that skirted the highroad a large rench convoy ofcavalry baggage and ussian prisoners separated from the rest of thearmy whichas was learned from spies and prisonerswas moving under astrong escort to molensk esides enisov and olokhov who also led asmall party and moved in enisovs vicinity the commanders of somelarge divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and as enisovexpressed it were sharpening their teeth for it wo of the commandersof large partiesone a ole and the other a ermansent invitations toenisov almost simultaneously requesting him to join up with theirdivisions to attack the convoyo bwother  have gwown mustaches myself said enisov on readingthese documents and he wrote to the erman that despite his heartfeltdesire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general he had to forgothat pleasure because he was already under the command of the olishgeneral o the olish general he replied to the same effect informinghim that he was already under the command of the ermanaving arranged matters thus enisov and olokhov intended withoutreporting matters to the higher command to attack and seize that convoywith their own small forces n ctober  it was moving from thevillage of ikulino to that of hamshevo o the left of the roadbetween ikulino and hamshevo there were large forests extending insome places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more backfrom it hrough these forests enisov and his party rode all daysometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the veryedge but never losing sight of the moving rench hat morningossacks of enisovs party had seized and carried off into the foresttwo wagons loaded with cavalry saddles which had stuck in the mud notfar from ikulino where the forest ran close to the road ince thenand until evening the party had watched the movements of the renchwithout attacking t was necessary to let the rench reach hamshevoquietly without alarming them and then after joining olokhov who wasto come that evening to a consultation at a watchmans hut in the forestless than a mile from hamshevo to surprise the rench at dawn fallinglike an avalanche on their heads from two sides and rout and capturethem all at one blown their rear more than a mile from ikulino where the forest cameright up to the road six ossacks were posted to report if any freshcolumns of rench should show themselveseyond hamshevo olokhov was to observe the road in the same way tofind out at what distance there were other rench troops hey reckonedthat the convoy had fifteen hundred men enisov had two hundred andolokhov might have as many more but the disparity of numbers did notdeter enisov ll that he now wanted to know was what troops these wereand to learn that he had to capture a tonguethat is a man from theenemy column hat mornings attack on the wagons had been made sohastily that the renchmen with the wagons had all been killed only alittle drummer boy had been taken alive and as he was a straggler hecould tell them nothing definite about the troops in that columnenisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear ofputting the whole column on the alert so he sent ikhon hcherbaty apeasant of his party to hamshevo to try and seize at least one of therench quartermasters who had been sent on in advance t was a warm rainy autumn day he sky and the horizon were both thecolor of muddy water t times a sort of mist descended and thensuddenly heavy slanting rain came downenisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran downwas riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides ike his horsewhich turned its head and laid its ears back he shrank from the drivingrain and gazed anxiously before him is thin face with its short thickblack beard looked angryeside enisov rode an esaul  enisovs fellow worker also in feltcloak and sheepskin cap and riding a large sleek on horse  captain of ossackssaul ovayski the hird was a tall man as straight as an arrow palefaced fairhaired with narrow light eyes and with calm selfsatisfaction in his face and bearing hough it was impossible to say inwhat the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay yet at first glance atthe esaul and enisov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortableand was a man mounted on a horse while looking at the esaul one sawthat he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he wasnot a man who had mounted a horse but a man who was one with his horsea being consequently possessed of twofold strength little ahead of them walked a peasant guide wet to the skin andwearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap little behind on a poor small lean irghiz mount with an enormoustail and

to thehussar with cold red hands and raising his eyebrows gazed about himwith surprise his was the rench drummer boy captured that morningehind them along the narrow sodden cutup forest road came hussars inthrees and fours and then ossacks some in felt cloaks some in renchgreatcoats and some with horsecloths over their heads he horsesbeing drenched by the rain all looked black whether chestnut

anything since morning and yet more because hestill had no news from olokhov and the man sent to capture a tonguehad not returnedherell hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as todayts too risky to attack them by oneself and if we put it off tillanother day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the preyfrom under our noses thought enisov continually peering forwardhoping

to pull them down under his greatcoat so that no oneshould notice it while maintaining as martial an air as possibleill there be any orders your honor he asked enisov holding hishand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general forwhich he had prepared himself or shall  remain with your honorrders enisov repeated thoughtfully ut can you stay tilltomowwowh please ay  stay with you cried etyaut just what did the genewal tell you o weturn at once askedenisovetya blushede gave me no instructions  think  could he returned inquiringlyell all wight said enisovnd turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting placearranged near the watchmans hut in the forest and told the officer onthe irghiz horse who performed the duties of an adjutant to go andfind out where olokhov was and whether he would come that eveningenisov himself intended going with the esaul and etya to the edge ofthe forest where it reached out to hamshevo to have a look at the partof the rench bivouac they were to attack next dayell old fellow said he to the peasant guide lead us tohamshevoenisov etya and the esaul accompanied by some ossacks and thehussar who had the prisoner rode to the left across a ravine to theedge of the forest he rain had stopped and only the mist was falling and drops from thetrees enisov the esaul and etya rode silently following thepeasant in the knitted cap who stepping lightly with outturned toes andmoving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leavessilently led them to the edge of the foreste ascended an incline stopped looked about him and advanced to wherethe screen of trees was less dense n reaching a large oak tree thathad not yet shed its leaves he stopped and beckoned mysteriously tothem with his handenisov and etya rode up to him rom the spot where the peasant wasstanding they could see the rench mmediately beyond the forest on adownward slope lay a field of spring rye o the right beyond a steepravine was a small village and a landowners house with a broken roofn the village in the house in the garden by the well by the pondover all the rising ground and all along the road uphill from thebridge leading to the village not more than five hundred yards awaycrowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist heir unussian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with thecarts and their calls to one another could be clearly heardwing the prisoner here said enisov in a low voice not taking hiseyes off the rench ossack dismounted lifted the boy down and took him to enisovointing to the rench troops enisov asked him what these and those ofthem were he boy thrusting his cold hands into his pockets andlifting his eyebrows looked at enisov in affright but in spite of anevident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers merelyassenting to everything enisov asked him enisov turned away from himfrowning and addressed the esaul conveying his own conjectures to himetya rapidly turning his head looked now at the drummer boy now atenisov now at the esaul and now at the rench in the village andalong the road trying not to miss anything of importancehether olokhov comes or not we must seize it eh said enisov witha merry sparkle in his eyest is a very suitable spot said the esaulell send the infantwy down by the swamps enisov continuedheyll cweep up to the garden youll wide up fwom there with theossackshe pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the villageand with my hussars fwom here nd at the signal shothe hollow is impassabletheres a swamp there said the esaul hehorses would sink e must ride round more to the lefthile they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded fromthe low ground by the pond a puff of white smoke appeared thenanother and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry rench voicesshouting together came up from the slope or a moment enisov and theesaul drew back hey were so near that they thought they were the causeof the firing and shouting ut the firing and shouting did not relateto them own below a man wearing something red was running through themarsh he rench were evidently firing and shouting at himhy thats our ikhon said the esaulo it is t ishe wascal said enisovell get away said the esaul screwing up his eyeshe man whom they called ikhon having run to the stream plunged in sothat the water splashed in the air and having disappeared for aninstant scrambled out on all fours all black with the wet and ran onhe rench who had been pursuing him stoppedmart that said the esaulhat a beast said enisov with his former look of vexation hat hashe been doing all this timeho is he asked etyaes our plastun  sent him to capture a tongueh yes said etya nodding at the first words enisov uttered as ifhe understood it all though he really did not understand anything ofitikhon hcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their bande was a peasant from okrovsk near the river zhat hen enisov hadcome to okrovsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usualsummoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the renchthe elder as though shielding himself had replied as all villageelders did that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them utwhen enisov explained that his purpose was to kill the rench andasked if no rench had strayed that way the elder replied that somemoreorderers had really been at their village but that ikhonhcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters enisov hadikhon called and having praised him for his activity said a few wordsin the elders presence about loyalty to the sar and the country andthe hatred of the rench that all sons of the fatherland should cherishe dont do the rench any harm said ikhon evidently frightened byenisovs words e only fooled about with the lads for fun you knowe killed a score or so of moreorderers but we did no harm elseext day when enisov had left okrovsk having quite forgotten aboutthis peasant it was reported to him that ikhon had attached himself totheir party and asked to be allowed to remain with it enisov gaveorders to let him do soikhon who at first did rough work laying campfires fetching waterflaying dead horses and so on soon showed a great liking and aptitudefor partisan warfare t night he would go out for booty and alwaysbrought back rench clothing and weapons and when told to would bringin rench captives also enisov then relieved him from drudgery andbegan taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had himenrolled among the ossacksikhon did not like riding and always went on foot never laggingbehind the cavalry e was armed with a musketoon which he carriedrather as a joke a pike and an ax which latter he used as a wolf usesits teeth with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunchingthick bones ikhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows atarms length or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegsor carve spoons n enisovs party he held a peculiar and exceptionalposition hen anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be doneto push a cart out of the mud with ones shoulders pull a horse out ofa swamp by its tail skin it slink in among the rench or walk morethan thirty miles in a dayeverybody pointed laughingly at ikhont wont hurt that devilhes as strong as a horse they said of himnce a renchman ikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him andshot him in the fleshy part of the back hat wound which ikhontreated only with internal and external applications of vodka was thesubject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachmentjokes in whichikhon readily joinedallo mate ever again ave you a twist the ossacks would banterhim nd ikhon purposely writhing and making faces pretended to beangry and swore at the rench with the funniest curses he only effectof this incident on ikhon was that after being wounded he seldombrought in prisonerse was the bravest and most useful man in the party o one found moreopportunities for attacking no one captured or killed more renchmenand consequently he was made the buffoon of all the ossacks and hussarsand willingly accepted that role ow he had been sent by enisovovernight to hamshevo to capture a tongue ut whether because he hadnot been content to take only one renchman or because he had sleptthrough the night he had crept by day into some bushes right among therench and as enisov had witnessed from above had been detected bythem fter talking for some time with the esaul about next days attackwhich now seeing how near they were to the rench he seemed to havedefinitely decided on enisov turned his horse and rode backow my lad well go and get dwy he said to etyas they approached the watchhouse enisov stopped peering into theforest mong the trees a man with long legs and long swinging armswearing a short jacket bast shoes and a azan hat was approachingwith long light steps e had a musketoon over his shoulder and an axstuck in his girdle hen he espied enisov he hastily threw somethinginto the bushes removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim andapproached his commander t was ikhon is wrinkled and pockmarkedface and narrow little eyes beamed with selfsatisfied merriment elifted his head high and gazed at enisov as if repressing a laughell where did you disappear to inquired enisovhere did  disappear to  went to get renchmen answered ikhonboldly and hurriedly in a husky but melodious bass voicehy did you push yourself in there by daylight ou ass ell whyhavent you taken oneh  took one all right said ikhonhere is heou see  took him first thing at dawn ikhon continued spreadingout his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes  took himinto the forest hen  see hes no good and think ll go and fetch alikelier oneou see hat a wogueits just as  thought said enisov to theesaul hy didnt you bwing that onehat was the good of bringing him ikhon interrupted hastily andangrilythat one wouldnt have done for you s if  dont know whatsort you wanthat a bwute you are ell went for another one ikhon continued and  crept like thisthrough the wood and lay down e suddenly lay down on his stomachwith a supple movement to show how he had done it ne turned up and grabbed him like this e jumped up quickly and lightly omealong to the colonel  said e starts yelling and suddenly therewere four of them hey rushed at me with their little swords o  wentfor them with my ax this way hat are you up to says  hrist bewith you shouted ikhon waving his arms with an angry scowl andthrowing out his chestes we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through thepuddles said the esaul screwing up his glittering eyesetya badly wanted to laugh but noticed that they all refrained fromlaughing e turned his eyes rapidly from ikhons face to the esaulsand enisovs unable to make out what it all meantont play the fool said enisov coughing angrily hy didnt youbwing the first oneikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the otherthen suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming foolish grindisclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth that was why he was calledhcherbatythe gaptoothed enisov smiled and etya burst into apeal of merry laughter in which ikhon himself joinedh but he was a regular goodfornothing said ikhon he clotheson himpoor stuff ow could  bring him nd so rude your honor hyhe says m a generals son myself  wont go he saysou are a bwute said enisov  wanted to questionut  questioned him said ikhon e said he didnt know muchhere are a lot of us he says but all poor stuffonly soldiers inname he says hout loud at them he says and youll take themall ikhon concluded looking cheerfully and resolutely intoenisovs eyesll give you a hundwed sharp lashesthatll teach you to play thefool said enisov severelyut why are you angry remonstrated ikhon just as if d never seenyour renchmen nly wait till it gets dark and ll fetch you any ofthem you wantthree if you likeell lets go said enisov and rode all the way to the watchhousein silence and frowning angrilyikhon followed behind and etya heard the ossacks laughing with himand at him about some pair of boots he had thrown into the busheshen the fit of laughter that had seized him at ikhons words and smilehad passed and etya realized for a moment that this ikhon had killed aman he felt uneasy e looked round at the captive drummer boy and felta pang in his heart ut this uneasiness lasted only a moment e feltit necessary to hold his head higher to brace himself and to questionthe esaul with an air of importance about tomorrows undertaking thathe might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himselfhe officer who had been sent to inquire met enisov on the way with thenews that olokhov was soon coming and that all was well with himenisov at once cheered up and calling etya to him said ell tellme about yourself etya having left his people after their departure from oscow joinedhis regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding alarge guerrilla detachment rom the time he received his commissionand especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in thebattle of yazma etya had been in a constant state of blissfulexcitement at being grownup and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not tomiss any chance to do something really heroic e was highly delightedwith what he saw and experienced in the army but at the same time italways seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were beingperformed just where he did not happen to be nd he was always in ahurry to get where he was nothen on the twentyfirst of ctober his general expressed a wish to sendsomebody to enisovs detachment etya begged so piteously to be sentthat the general could not refuse ut when dispatching him he recalledetyas mad action at the battle of yazma where instead of riding bythe road to the place to which he had been sent he had galloped to theadvanced line under the fire of the rench and had there twice fired hispistol o now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in anyaction whatever of enisovs hat was why etya had blushed and grownconfused when enisov asked him whether he could stay efore they hadridden to the outskirts of the forest etya had considered he must carryout his instructions strictly and return at once ut when he saw therench and saw ikhon and learned that there would certainly be anattack that night he decided with the rapidity with which young peoplechange their views that the general whom he had greatly respected tillthen was a rubbishy erman that enisov was a hero the esaul a heroand ikhon a hero too and that it would be shameful for him to leavethem at a moment of difficultyt was already growing dusk when enisov etya and the esaul rode upto the watchhouse n the twilight saddled horses could be seen andossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade andwere kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the renchcould not see the smoke n the passage of the small watchhouse aossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton n the roomthree officers of enisovs band were converting a door into a tabletopetya took off his wet clothes gave them to be dried and at once beganhelping the officers to fix up the dinner tablen ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it n thetable were vodka a flask of rum white bread roast mutton and saltitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory muttonwith his hands down which the grease trickled etya was in an ecstaticchildish state of love for all men and consequently of confidence thatothers loved him in the same wayo then what do you think asili mitrich said he to enisov tsall right my staying a day with you nd not waiting for a reply heanswered his own question ou see  was told to find outwell  amfinding out nly do let me into the very into the chief dont want a reward ut  wantetya clenched his teeth and looked around throwing back his head andflourishing his armsnto the vewy chief enisov repeated with a smilenly please let me command something so that  may really commandetya went on hat would it be to you h you want a knife hesaid turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of muttonnd he handed him his clasp knife he officer admired itlease keep it  have several like it said etya blushingeavens  was quite forgetting he suddenly cried  have someraisins fine ones you know seedless ones e have a new sutler and hehas such capital things  bought ten pounds  am used to somethingsweet ould you like some and etya ran out into the passage tohis ossack and brought back some bags which contained about five poundsof raisins ave some gentlemen have someou want a coffeepot dont you he asked the esaul  bought

etya stopped andblushede tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that wasfoolish nd running over the events of the day he remembered the renchdrummer boy ts capital for us here but what of him here have theyput him ave they fed him avent they hurt his feelings he thoughtut having caught himself saying too much about the flints he was nowafraid to speak out might ask he thought but theyll say es a boy himself and sohe pities the boy ll show them tomorrow whether m a boy ill itseem odd if  ask etya thought ell never mind and immediatelyblushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appearedironical he saiday  call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something toeat erhapses hes a poor little fellow said enisov who evidently sawnothing shameful in this reminder all him in is name is incentosse ave him fetchedll call him said etyaes yes call him  poor little fellow enisov repeatedetya was standing at the door when enisov said this e slipped inbetween the officers came close to enisov and saidet me kiss you dear old fellow h how fine how splendidnd having kissed enisov he ran out of the hutosse incent etya cried stopping outside the doorho do you want sir asked a voice in the darknessetya replied that he wanted the rench lad who had been captured thatdayh esenny said a ossackincent the boys name had already been changed by the ossacks intoesenny vernal and into esenya by the peasants and soldiers n boththese adaptations the reference to spring vesna matched the impressionmade by the young lade is warming himself there by the bonfire o esenya esenyaesenny laughing voices were heard calling to one another in thedarknesses a smart lad said an hussar standing near etya e gave himsomething to eat a while ago e was awfully hungryhe sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in thedarkness and the drummer boy came to the doorh cest vous said etya oulezvous manger ayez pas peur onne vous fera pas de mal  he added shyly and affectionately touchingthe boys hand ntrez entrez  h its you o you want something to eat ont be afraid theywont hurt you  ome in come inerci monsieur  said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childishvoice and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold hank you sirhere were many things etya wanted to say to the drummer boy but didnot dare to e stood irresolutely beside him in the passage hen inthe darkness he took the boys hand and pressed itome in come in he repeated in a gentle whisper h what can  dofor him he thought and opening the door he let the boy pass in firsthen the boy had entered the hut etya sat down at a distance from himconsidering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him ut hefingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seemridiculous to give some to the drummer boy he arrival of olokhov diverted etyas attention from the drummer boyto whom enisov had had some mutton and vodka given and whom he had haddressed in a ussian coat so that he might be kept with their band andnot sent away with the other prisoners etya had heard in the army manystories of olokhovs extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to therench so from the moment he entered the hut etya did not take hiseyes from him but braced himself up more and more and held his headhigh that he might not be unworthy even of such companyolokhovs appearance amazed etya by its simplicityenisov wore a ossack coat had a beard had an icon of icholas theonderorker on his breast and his way of speaking and everything hedid indicated his unusual position ut olokhov who in oscow had worna ersian costume had now the appearance of a most correct officer ofthe uards e was cleanshaven and wore a uardsmans padded coat withan rder of t eorge at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap setstraight on his head e took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of theroom and without greeting anyone went up to enisov and beganquestioning him about the matter in hand enisov told him of thedesigns the large detachments had on the transport of the message etyahad brought and his own replies to both generals hen he told him allhe knew of the rench detachmenthats so ut we must know what troops they are and their numberssaid olokhov t will be necessary to go there e cant start theaffair without knowing for certain how many there are  like to workaccurately ere nowwouldnt one of these gentlemen like to ride overto the rench camp with me  have brought a spare uniform  ll go with you cried etyaheres no need for you to go at all said enisov addressingolokhov and as for him  wont let him go on any account like that exclaimed etya hy shouldnt  goecause its uselessell you must excuse me because because  shall go and thatsall oull take me wont you he said turning to olokhovhy not olokhov answered absently scrutinizing the face of therench drummer boy ave you had that youngster with you long heasked enisove was taken today but he knows nothing m keeping him with mees and where do you put the others inquired olokhovhere  send them away and take a weceipt for them shouted enisovsuddenly flushing nd  say boldly that  have not a single mans lifeon my conscience ould it be difficult for you to send thirty or thweehundwed men to town under escort instead of staining speak bluntlystaining the honor of a soldierhat kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count ofsixteen said olokhov with cold irony but its time for you to dropithy ve not said anything  only say that ll certainly go withyou said etya shylyut for you and me old fellow its time to drop these amenitiescontinued olokhov as if he found particular pleasure in speaking ofthis subject which irritated enisov ow why have you kept this ladhe went on swaying his head ecause you are sorry for him ont weknow those receipts of yours ou send a hundred men away and thirtyget there he rest either starve or get killed o isnt it all thesame not to send themhe esaul screwing up his lightcolored eyes nodded approvinglyhats not the point m not going to discuss the matter  do notwish to take it on my conscience ou say theyll die ll wight nlynot by my

we must get to workell the ossack to fetch my kit  have two rench uniforms in itell are you coming with me he asked etya es yes certainly cried etya blushing almost to tears andglancing at enisovhile olokhov had been disputing with enisov what should be done withprisoners etya had once more felt awkward and restless but again hehad no time to grasp fully what they were talking about f grownupdistinguished men think so it must be necessary and right thought heut above all enisov must not dare to imagine that ll obey him andthat he can order me about  will certainly go to the rench camp witholokhov f he can so can nd to all enisovs persuasions etya replied that he too wasaccustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow and that henever considered personal dangeror youll admit that if we dont know for sure how many of them thereare hundreds of lives may depend on it while there are only two ofus esides  want to go very much and certainly will go so donthinder me said he t will only make things worse aving put on rench greatcoats and shakos etya and olokhov rode tothe clearing from which enisov had reconnoitered the rench camp andemerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into thehollow n reaching the bottom olokhov told the ossacks accompanyinghim to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to thebridge etya his heart in his mouth with excitement rode by his sidef were caught  wont be taken alive  have a pistol whisperedheont talk ussian said olokhov in a hurried whisper and at thatvery moment they heard through the darkness the challenge ui vive and the click of a musket ho goes therehe blood rushed to etyas face and he grasped his pistolanciers du me  replied olokhov neither hastening nor slackeninghis horses pace ancers of the th egimenthe black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridgeot dordre  asswordolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walkites donc le colonel erard est ici  he asked ell me is olonel erard hereot dordre repeated the sentinel barring the way and not replyinguand un officier fait sa ronde les sentinelles ne demandent pas lemot dordre cried olokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straightat the sentinel e vous demande si le colonel est ici  hen an officer is making his round sentinels dont ask him for thepassword  am asking you if the colonel is herend without waiting for an answer from the sentinel who had steppedaside olokhov rode up the incline at a walkoticing the black outline of a man crossing the road olokhov stoppedhim and inquired where the commander and officers were he man asoldier with a sack over his shoulder stopped came close up toolokhovs horse touched it with his hand and explained simply and ina friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up thehill to the right in the courtyard of the farm as he called thelandowners houseaving ridden up the road on both sides of which rench talk could beheard around the campfires olokhov turned into the courtyard of thelandowners house aving ridden in he dismounted and approached a bigblazing campfire around which sat several men talking noisilyomething was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and asoldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat lit up by the fire waskneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrodh hes a hard nut to crack said one of the officers who was sittingin the shadow at the other side of the fireell make them get a move on those fellows said another laughingoth fell silent peering out through the darkness at the sound ofolokhovs and etyas steps as they advanced to the fire leading theirhorsesonjour messieurs  said olokhov loudly and clearly ood day gentlemenhere was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire andone tall longnecked officer walking round the fire came up toolokhovs that you lement he asked here the devil ut noticinghis mistake he broke off short and with a frown greeted olokhov as astranger asking what he could do for himolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake theirregiment and addressing the company in general asked whether they knewanything of the th egiment one of them knew anything and etyathought the officers were beginning to look at him and olokhov withhostility and suspicion or some seconds all were silentf you were counting on the evening soup you have come too late saida voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugholokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther thatnighte handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot andsquatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the longneck hat officer did not take his eyes from olokhov and again askedto what regiment he belonged olokhov as if he had not heard thequestion did not reply but lighting a short rench pipe which he tookfrom his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before themwas safe from ossackshose brigands are everywhere replied an officer from behind thefireolokhov remarked that the ossacks were a danger only to stragglerssuch as his companion and himself but probably they would not dare toattack large detachments he added inquiringly o one repliedell now hell come away etya thought every moment as he stood bythe campfire listening to the talkut olokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and beganputting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalionhow many battalions and how many prisoners sking about the ussianprisoners with that detachment olokhov said horrid business dragging these corpses about with one t would bebetter to shoot such rabble and burst into loud laughter so strangethat etya thought the rench would immediately detect their disguiseand involuntarily took a step back from the campfireo one replied a word to olokhovs laughter and a rench officer whomthey could not see he lay wrapped in a greatcoat rose and whisperedsomething to a companion olokhov got up and called to the soldier whowas holding their horsesill they bring our horses or not thought etya instinctivelydrawing nearer to olokhovhe horses were broughtood evening gentlemen said olokhovetya wished to say ood night but could not utter a word heofficers were whispering together olokhov was a long time mounting hishorse which would not stand still then he rode out of the yard at afootpace etya rode beside him longing to look round to see whether ornot the rench were running after them but not daring tooming out onto the road olokhov did not ride back across the opencountry but through the village t one spot he stopped and listenedo you hear he asked etya recognized the sound of ussian voicesand saw the dark figures of ussian prisoners round their campfireshen they had descended to the bridge etya and olokhov rode past thesentinel who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it thenthey descended into the hollow where the ossacks awaited themell now goodby ell enisov at the first shot at daybreak saidolokhov and was about to ride away but etya seized hold of himeally he cried you are such a hero h how fine how splendidow  love youll right all right said olokhov ut etya did not let go of himand olokhov saw through the gloom that etya was bending toward him andwanted to kiss him olokhov kissed him laughed turned his horse andvanished into the darkness aving returned to the watchmans hut etya found enisov in thepassage e was awaiting etyas return in a state of agitationanxiety and selfreproach for having let him gohank od he exclaimed es thank od he repeated listening toetyas rapturous account ut devil take you  havent slept becauseof you ell thank od ow lie down e can still get a nap

details of hisexpedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next dayhen noticing that enisov was asleep he rose and went out of doorst was still quite dark outside he rain was over but drops were stillfalling from the trees ear the watchmans hut the black shapes of theossacks shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen ehindthe hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside themwere discernible and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red otall the ossacks and hussars were asleep here and there amid thesounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by could beheard low voices which seemed to be whisperingetya came out peered into the darkness and went up to the wagonsomeone was snoring under them and around them stood saddled horsesmunching their oats n the dark etya recognized his own horse whichhe called arabakh though it was of kranian breed and went up to itell arabakh ell do some service tomorrow said he sniffing

hussar as thecup left herehere by the wheelhe hussar took the cupt must be daylight soon said he yawning and went awayetya ought to have known that he was in a forest with enisovsguerrilla band less than a mile from the road sitting on a wagoncaptured from the rench beside which horses were tethered that underit ikhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him that the big darkblotch to the right was the watchmans hut and the red blotch below tothe left was the dying embers of a campfire that the man who had comefor the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink but he neither knew norwaited to know anything of all this e was in a fairy kingdom wherenothing resembled reality he big dark blotch might really be thewatchmans hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of theearth erhaps the red spot was a fire or it might be the eye of anenormous monster erhaps he was really sitting on a wagon but it mightvery well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly hightower from which if he fell he would have to fall for a whole day or awhole month or go on falling and never reach the bottom erhaps it wasjust the ossack ikhachev who was sitting under the wagon but itmight be the kindest bravest most wonderful most splendid man in theworld whom no one knew of t might really have been that the hussarcame for water and went back into the hollow but perhaps he had simplyvanisheddisappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingnessothing etya could have seen now would have surprised him e was in afairy kingdom where everything was possiblee looked up at the sky nd the sky was a fairy realm like the eartht was clearing and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftlysailing as if unveiling the stars ometimes it looked as if the cloudswere passing and a clear black sky appeared ometimes it seemed as ifthe black spaces were clouds ometimes the sky seemed to be risinghigh high overhead and then it seemed to sink so low that one couldtouch it with ones

whetstone andsuddenly etya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknownsweetly solemn hymn etya was as musical as atasha and more so thanicholas but had never learned music or thought about it and so themelody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularlyfresh and attractive he music became more and more audible he melodygrew and passed from one instrument to another nd what was played wasa fuguethough etya had not the least conception of what a fugue isach instrumentnow resembling a violin and now a horn but better andclearer than violin or hornplayed its own part and before it hadfinished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost thesame air and then with a third and a fourth and they all blended intoone and again became separate and again blended now into solemn churchmusic now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphanthwhy that was in a dream etya said to himself as he lurchedforward ts in my ears ut perhaps its music of my own ell goon my music owe closed his eyes and from all sides as if from a distance soundsfluttered grew into harmonies separated blended and again allmingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn h this is delightful smuch as  like and as  like said etya to himself e tried toconduct that enormous orchestraow softly softly die away and the sounds obeyed him ow fullermore joyful till more and more joyful nd from an unknown depth roseincreasingly triumphant sounds ow voices join in ordered etya ndat first from afar he heard mens voices and then womens he voicesgrew in harmonious triumphant strength and etya listened to theirsurpassing beauty in awe and joyith a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song the drip from thetrees and the hissing of the saber zhegzhegzheg and again thehorses jostled one another and neighed not disturbing the choir butjoining in itetya did not know how long this lasted he enjoyed himself all thetime wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one toshare it e was awakened by ikhachevs kindly voicets ready your honor you can split a renchman in half with itetya woke upts getting light its really getting light he exclaimedhe horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to theirvery tails and a watery light showed itself through the bare branchesetya shook himself jumped up took a ruble from his pocket and

late again flashed throughetyas mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firingcould be heard he shots came from the yard of the landowners house hehad visited the night before with olokhov he rench were making astand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown withbushes and were firing at the ossacks who crowded at the gatewayhrough the smoke as he approached the

their march from oscow no fresh orders had beenissued by the rench authorities concerning the party of prisoners amongwhom was ierre n the twentysecond of ctober that party was nolonger with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had leftoscow alf the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the firststages with them had been captured by ossacks the other half had goneon ahead ot one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched infront of the prisoners was left they had all disappeared he artillerythe prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was nowreplaced by arshal unots enormous baggage train convoyed byestphalians ehind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage trainrom yazma onwards the rench army which had till then moved in threecolumns went on as a single group he symptoms of disorder that ierrehad noticed at their first halting place after leaving oscow had nowreached the utmost limithe road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by deadhorses ragged men who had fallen behind from various regimentscontinually changed about now joining the moving column now againlagging behind iteveral times during the march false alarms had been given and thesoldiers of the escort had raised their muskets fired and runheadlong crushing one another but had afterwards reassembled andabused each other for their causeless panichese three groups traveling togetherthe cavalry stores the convoy ofprisoners and unots baggage trainstill constituted a separate andunited whole though each of the groups was rapidly melting awayf the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred andtwenty wagons not more than sixty now remained the rest had beencaptured or left behind ome of unots wagons also had been capturedor abandoned hree wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers fromavouts corps rom the talk of the ermans ierre learned that alarger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to theprisoners and that one of their comrades a erman soldier had beenshot by the marshals own order because a silver spoon belonging to themarshal had been found in his possessionhe group of prisoners had melted away most of all f the three hundredand thirty men who had set out from oscow fewer than a hundred nowremained he prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even thecavalry saddles or unots baggage hey understood that the saddles andunots spoon might be of some use but that cold and hungry soldiersshould have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry ussians whofroze and lagged behind on the road in which case the order was toshoot them was not merely incomprehensible but revolting nd theescort as if afraid in the grievous condition they themselves were inof giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so renderingtheir own plight still worse treated them with particular morosenessand severityt orogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy after locking theprisoners in a stable had gone off to pillage their own stores severalof the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away but wererecaptured by the rench and shothe arrangement adopted when they started that the officer prisonersshould be kept separate from the rest had long since been abandonedll who could walk went together and after the third stage ierre hadrejoined arataev and the grayblue bandylegged dog that had chosenarataev for its mastern the third day after leaving oscow arataev again fell ill with thefever he had suffered from in the hospital in oscow and as he grewgradually weaker ierre kept away from him ierre did not know why butsince arataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to gonear him hen he did so and heard the subdued moaning with whicharataev generally lay down at the halting places and when he smelledthe odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before ierremoved farther away and did not think about himhile imprisoned in the shed ierre had learned not with his intellectbut with his whole being by life itself that man is created forhappiness that happiness is within him in the satisfaction of simplehuman needs and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but fromsuperfluity nd now during these last three weeks of the march he hadlearned still another new consolatory truththat nothing in this worldis terrible e had learned that as there is no condition in which mancan be happy and entirely free so there is no condition in which heneed be unhappy and lack freedom e learned that suffering and freedomhave their limits and that those limits are very near together that theperson in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly ashe now sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilledwhile the other was warming and that when he had put on tight dancingshoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feetthat were covered with soreshis footgear having long since fallen topieces e discovered that when he had married his wifeof his own freewill as it had seemed to himhe had been no more free than now whenthey locked him up at night in a stable f all that he himselfsubsequently termed his sufferings but which at the time he scarcelyfelt the worst was the state of his bare raw and scabcovered feethe horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing the saltpeter flavor ofthe gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant there was nogreat cold it was always warm walking in the daytime and at nightthere were the campfires the lice that devoured him warmed his bodyhe one thing that was at first hard to bear was his feetfter the second days march ierre having examined his feet by thecampfire thought it would be impossible to walk on them but wheneverybody got up he went along limping and when he had warmed upwalked without feeling the pain though at night his feet were moreterrible to look at than before owever he did not look at them nowbut thought of other thingsnly now did ierre realize the full strength of life in man and thesaving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing toanother which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allowssuperfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limite did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who laggedbehind though more than a hundred perished in that way e did notthink of arataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soonhave to share that fate till less did ierre think about himself heharder his position became and the more terrible the future the moreindependent of that position in which he found himself were the joyfuland comforting thoughts memories and imaginings that came to him t midday on the twentysecond of ctober ierre was going uphill alongthe muddy slippery road looking at his feet and at the roughness ofthe way ccasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him andthen again at his feet he former and the latter were alike familiarand his own he bluegray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the sideof the road sometimes in proof of its agility and selfsatisfactionlifting one hind leg and hopping along on three and then again going onall four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion hedog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in oscow ll around laythe flesh of different animalsfrom men to horsesin various stages ofdecomposition and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men thedog could eat all it wantedt had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment itmight cease and the sky clear but after a short break it began rainingharder than before he saturated road no longer absorbed the waterwhich ran along the ruts in streamsierre walked along looking from side to side counting his steps inthrees and reckoning them off on his fingers entally addressing therain he repeated ow then now then go on elt hardert seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing but far down and deepwithin him his soul was occupied with something important andcomforting his something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from aconversation with arataev the day beforet their yesterdays halting place feeling chilly by a dying campfireierre had got up and gone to the next one which was burning betterhere laton arataev was sitting covered uphead and allwith hisgreatcoat as if it were a vestment telling the soldiers in hiseffective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story ierre knew twas already past midnight the hour when arataev was usually free ofhis fever and particularly lively hen ierre reached the fire andheard latons voice enfeebled by illness and saw his pathetic facebrightly lit up by the blaze he felt a painful prick at his heart isfeeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go awaybut there was no other fire and ierre sat down trying not to look atlatonell how are you he askedow am  f we grumble at sickness od wont grant us death repliedlaton and at once resumed the story he had begunnd so brother he continued with a smile on his pale emaciated faceand a particularly happy light in his eyes you see brotherierre had long been familiar with that story arataev had told it tohim alone some halfdozen times and always with a specially joyfulemotion ut well as he knew it ierre now listened to that tale as tosomething new and the quiet rapture arataev evidently felt as he toldit communicated itself also to ierre he story was of an old merchantwho lived a good and odfearing life with his family and who went onceto the izhni fair with a companiona rich merchantaving put up at an inn they both went to sleep and next morning hiscompanion was found robbed and with his throat cut  bloodstained knifewas found under the old merchants pillow e was tried knouted andhis nostrils having been torn off all in due form as arataev put ithe was sent to hard labor in iberiand so brother it was at this point that ierre came up ten yearsor more passed by he old man was living as a convict submitting as heshould and doing no wrong nly he prayed to od for death ell onenight the convicts were gathered just as we are with the old man amongthem nd they began telling what each was suffering for and how theyhad sinned against od ne told how he had taken a life another hadtaken two a third had set a house on fire while another had simplybeen a vagrant and had done nothing o they asked the old man hatare you being punished for addy my dear brothers said he ambeing punished for my own and other mens sins ut  have not killedanyone or taken anything that was not mine but have only helped mypoorer brothers  was a merchant my dear brothers and had muchproperty nd he went on to tell them all about it in due order dont grieve for myself he says od it seems has chastened menly  am sorry for my old wife and the children and the old man beganto weep ow it happened that in the group was the very man who hadkilled the other merchant here did it happen addy he said henand in what month e asked all about it and his heart began to acheo he comes up to the old man like this and falls down at his feetou are perishing because of me addy he says ts quite truelads that this man he says is being tortured innocently and fornothing  he says did that deed and  put the knife under yourhead while you were asleep orgive me addy he says for hristssakearataev paused smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire and he drewthe logs togethernd the old man said od will forgive you we are all sinners in issight  suffer for my own sins and he wept bitter tears ell andwhat do you think dear friends arataev continued his facebrightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now hadto tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his storyhat do you think dear fellows hat murderer confessed to theauthorities  have taken six lives he says he was a great sinnerbut what  am most sorry for is this old man ont let him sufferbecause of me o he confessed and it was all written down and thepapers sent off in due form he place was a long way off and whilethey were judging what with one thing and another filling in thepapers all in due formthe authorities  meantime passed he affairreached the sar fter a while the sars decree came to set themerchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded hepaper arrived and they began to look for the old man here is the oldman who has been suffering innocently and in vain  paper has come fromthe sar so they began looking for him here arataevs lower jawtrembled but od had already forgiven himhe was dead hats how itwas dear fellows arataev concluded and sat for a long time silentgazing before him with a smilend ierres soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itselfbut by its mysterious significance by the rapturous joy that lit uparataevs face as he told it and the mystic significance of that joy  vos places  suddenly cried a voice o your places pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyfuland solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and theprisoners rom all sides came shouts of command and from the left camesmartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses passing the prisoners at atrot he expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at theapproach of those in authority he prisoners thronged together and werepushed off the road he convoy formed uphe mperor he mperor he arshal he uke and hardly had thesleek cavalry passed before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattledby ierre caught a glimpse of a man in a threecornered hat with atranquil look on his handsome plump white face t was one of themarshals is eye fell on ierres large and striking figure and in theexpression with which he frowned and looked away ierre thought hedetected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathyhe general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with ared and frightened face whipping up his skinny horse everal officersformed a group and some soldiers crowded round them heir faces alllooked excited and worriedhat did he say hat did he say ierre heard them askhile the marshal was passing the prisoners had huddled together in acrowd and ierre saw arataev whom he had not yet seen that morning esat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree n his facebesides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while tellingthe tale of the merchant who suffered innocently there was now anexpression of quiet solemnityarataev looked at ierre with his kindly round eyes now filled withtears evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something tohim ut ierre was not sufficiently sure of himself e made as if hedid not notice that look and moved hastily awayhen the prisoners again went forward ierre looked round arataev wasstill sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and tworenchmen were talking over his head ierre did not look round againbut went limping up the hillrom behind where arataev had been sitting came the sound of a shotierre heard it plainly but at that moment he remembered that he hadnot yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained tomolenska calculation he had begun before the marshal went by nd heagain started reckoning wo rench soldiers ran past ierre one ofwhom carried a lowered and smoking gun hey both looked pale and inthe expression on their facesone of them glanced timidly at ierrethere was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the youngsoldier at the execution ierre looked at the soldier and rememberedthat two days before that man had burned his shirt while drying it atthe fire and how they had laughed at himehind him where arataev had been sitting the dog began to howlhat a stupid beast hy is it howling thought ierreis comrades the prisoner soldiers walking beside him avoided lookingback at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howlingjust as ierre did but there was a set look on all their faces he stores the prisoners and the marshals baggage train stopped atthe village of hamshevo he men crowded together round the campfiresierre went up to the fire ate some roast horseflesh lay down with hisback to the fire and immediately fell asleep e again slept as he haddone at ozhaysk after the battle of orodinogain real events mingled with dreams and again someone he or anothergave expression to his thoughts and even to the same thoughts that hadbeen expressed in his dream at ozhayskife is everything ife is od verything changes and moves and thatmovement is od nd while there is life there is joy in consciousnessof the divine o love life is to love od arder and more blessed thanall else is to love this life in ones sufferings in innocentsufferingsarataev came to ierres mindnd suddenly he saw vividly before him a longforgotten kindly old manwho had given him geography lessons in witzerland ait a bit saidthe old man and showed ierre a globe his globe was aliveavibrating ball without fixed dimensions ts whole surface consisted ofdrops closely pressed together and all these drops moved and changedplaces sometimes several of them merging into one sometimes onedividing into many ach drop tried to spread out and occupy as muchspace as possible but others striving to do the same compressed

expand so as to reflect imto the greatest extent nd it grows merges disappears from thesurface sinks to the depths and again emerges here now arataev hasspread out and disappeared o you understand my child said theteachero you understand damn you shouted a voice and ierre woke upe lifted himself and sat up  renchman who had just pushed a ussiansoldier away was squatting by the fire engaged in roasting a piece ofmeat stuck on a ramrod is sleeves were rolled up and his sinewyhairy red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod isbrown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow ofthe charcoalts all the same to him he muttered turning quickly to a soldierwho stood behind him rigand et awaynd twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at ierre who turned awayand gazed into the darkness  prisoner the ussian soldier therenchman had pushed away was sitting near the fire patting somethingwith his hand ooking more closely ierre recognized the bluegray dogsitting beside the soldier wagging its tailh hes come said ierre nd lat he began but did not finishuddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancyofthe look laton had given him as he sat under the tree of the shotheard from that spot of the dogs howl of the guilty faces of the tworenchmen as they ran past him of the lowered and smoking gun and ofarataevs absence at this haltand he was on the point of realizingthat arataev had been killed but just at that instant he knew notwhy the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spentwith a beautiful olish lady on the veranda of his house in iev ndwithout linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion fromthem ierre closed his eyes seeing a vision of the country insummertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid vibratingglobe and he sank into water so that it closed over his headefore sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firingrench soldiers were running past himhe ossacks one of them shouted and a moment later a crowd ofussians surrounded ierreor a long time he could not understand what was happening to him llaround he heard his comrades sobbing with joyrothers ear fellows arlings old soldiers exclaimed weeping asthey embraced ossacks and hussarshe hussars and ossacks crowded round the prisoners one offered themclothes another boots and a third bread ierre sobbed as he sat amongthem and could not utter a word e hugged the first soldier whoapproached him and kissed him weepingolokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house letting a crowd ofdisarmed renchmen pass by he rench excited by all that hadhappened were talking loudly among themselves but as they passedolokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched themwith cold glassy

alongenisov bareheaded and with a gloomy face walked behind some ossackswho were carrying the body of etya ostov to a hole that had been dugin the garden fter the twentyeighth of ctober when the frosts began the flight ofthe rench assumed a still more tragic character with men freezing orroasting themselves to death at the campfires while carriages withpeople dressed in furs continued to drive past carrying away theproperty that had been stolen by the mperor kings and dukes but theprocess of the flight and disintegration of the rench army went onessentially as beforerom oscow to yazma the rench army of seventythree thousand men notreckoning the uards who did nothing during the whole war but pillagewas reduced to thirtysix thousand though not more than five thousandhad fallen in battle rom this beginning the succeeding terms of theprogression could be determined mathematically he rench army meltedaway and perished at the same rate from oscow to yazma from yazma tomolensk from molensk to the erezina and from the erezina to ilnaindependently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold thepursuit the barring of the way or any other particular conditionseyond yazma the rench army instead of moving in three columns huddledtogether into one mass and so went on to the end erthier wrote to hismperor we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to divergefrom the truth in describing the condition of an army and this is whathe said deem it my duty to report to our ajesty the condition of the variouscorps  have had occasion to observe during different stages of the lasttwo or three days march hey are almost disbanded carcely a quarterof the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments the othersgo off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food andescape discipline n general they regard molensk as the place wherethey hope to recover uring the last few days many of the men have beenseen to throw away their cartridges and their arms n such a state ofaffairs whatever your ultimate plans may be the interest of ourajestys service demands that the army should be rallied at molenskand should first of all be freed from ineffectives such as dismountedcavalry unnecessary baggage and artillery material that is no longerin proportion to the present forces he soldiers who are worn out withhunger and fatigue need these supplies as well as a few days restany have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs hisstate of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear thatunless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be undercontrol in case of an engagementovember  twenty miles from molenskfter staggering into molensk which seemed to them a promised land therench searching for food killed one

ut theseorders and reports were only on paper nothing in them was acted uponfor they could not be carried out and though they entitled one anotherajesties ighnesses or ousins they all felt that they weremiserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to paynd though they pretended to be concerned about the army each wasthinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and savehimself he movements of the ussian and rench armies during the campaign fromoscow back to the iemen were like those in a game of ussianblindmans bluff in which two players are blindfolded and one of themoccasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of hiswhereabouts irst he rings his bell fearlessly but when he gets into atight place he runs away as quietly as he can and often thinking toescape runs straight into his opponents armst first while they were still moving along the aluga road apoleonsarmies made their presence known but later when they reached themolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tightandoften thinking they were escaping ran right into the ussianswing to the rapidity of the rench flight and the ussian pursuit andthe consequent exhaustion of the horses the chief means ofapproximately ascertaining the enemys positionby cavalry scoutingwas not available esides as a result of the frequent and rapid changeof position by each army even what information was obtained could notbe delivered in time f news was received one day that the enemy hadbeen in a certain position the day before by the third day whensomething could have been done that army was already two days marchfarther on and in quite another positionne army fled and the other pursued eyond molensk there were severaldifferent roads available for the rench and one would have thoughtthat during their stay of four days they might have learned where theenemy was might have arranged some more advantageous plan andundertaken something new ut after a four days halt the mob with nomaneuvers or plans again began running along the beaten track neitherto the right nor to the left but along the oldthe worstroad throughrasnoe and rshaxpecting the enemy from behind and not in front the rench separatedin their flight and spread out over a distance of twentyfour hours nfront of them all fled the mperor then the kings then the dukes heussian army expecting apoleon to

walls ofmolensk which were in nobodys way because despite the unfortunateplight of the rench or because of it they wished to punish the flooragainst which they had hurt themselves ey who had had a corps of tenthousand men reached apoleon at rsha with only one thousand men lefthaving abandoned all the rest and all his cannon and having crossed thenieper at night by stealth at a wooded spotrom

across the river fled farther heir supreme chief donned a furcoat and having seated himself in a sleigh galloped on aloneabandoning his companions he others who could do so drove away tooleaving those who could not to surrender or die his campaign consisted in a flight of the rench during which they didall they could to destroy themselves rom the time they turned onto thealuga road to the day their leader fled from the army none of themovements of the crowd had any sense o one might have thought thatregarding this period of the campaign the historians who attributed theactions of the mass to the will of one man would have found itimpossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory ut noountains of books have been written by the historians about thiscampaign and everywhere are described apoleons arrangements themaneuvers and his profound plans which guided the army as well as themilitary genius shown by his marshalshe retreat from aloaroslavets when he had a free road into a wellsupplied district and the parallel road was open to him along whichutuzov afterwards pursued himthis unnecessary retreat along adevastated roadis explained to us as being due to profoundconsiderations imilarly profound considerations are given for hisretreat from molensk to rsha hen his heroism at rasnoe isdescribed where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battleand take personal command and to have walked about with a birch stickand saidai assez fait lempereur il est temps de faire le general  butnevertheless immediately ran away again abandoning to its fate thescattered fragments of the army he left behind  have acted the mperor long enough it is time to act the generalhen we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals especially ofeya greatness of soul consisting in this that he made his way bynight around through the forest and across the nieper and escaped torsha abandoning standards artillery and nine tenths of his mennd lastly the final departure of the great mperor from his heroicarmy is presented to us by the historians as something great andcharacteristic of genius ven that final running away described inordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child istaught to be ashamed ofeven that act finds justification in thehistorians languagehen it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historicalratiocination any farther when actions are clearly contrary to all thathumanity calls right or even just the historians produce a savingconception of greatness reatness it seems excludes the standardsof right and wrong or the great man nothing is wrong there is noatrocity for which a great man can be blamedest grand  say the historians and there no longer exists eithergood or evil but only grand and not grand rand is good not grandis bad rand is the characteristic in their conception of somespecial animals called heroes nd apoleon escaping home in a warmfur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comradesbut were in his opinion men he had brought there feels que cestgrand  and his soul is tranquil t is great  hat it is greatu sublime he saw something sublime in himself au ridicule il ny aquun pas  said he nd the whole world for fifty years has beenrepeating ublime rand apoleon le rand u sublime au ridiculeil ny a quun pas rom the sublime to the ridiculous is but a stepnd it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable withthe standard of right and wrong is merely to admit ones own nothingnessand immeasurable meannessor us with the standard of good and evil given us by hrist no humanactions are incommensurable nd there is no greatness where simplicitygoodness and truth are absent hat ussian reading the account of the last part of the campaign of has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regretdissatisfaction and perplexity ho has not asked himself how it isthat the rench were not all captured or destroyed when our three armiessurrounded them in superior numbers when the disordered rench hungryand freezing surrendered in crowds and when as the historians relatethe aim of the ussians was to stop the rench to cut them off andcapture them allow was it that the ussian army which when numerically weaker than therench had given battle at orodino did not achieve its purpose when ithad surrounded the rench on three sides and when its aim was to capturethem an the rench be so enormously superior to us that when we hadsurrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them ow couldthat happenistory or what is called by that name replying to these questionssays that this occurred because utuzov and ormasov and hichagov andthis man and that man did not execute such and such maneuversut why did they not execute those maneuvers nd why if they wereguilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried andpunished ut even if we admitted that utuzov hichagov and otherswere the cause of the ussian failures it is still incomprehensiblewhy the position of the ussian army being what it was at rasnoe andat the erezina in both cases we had superior forces the rench armywith its marshals kings and mperor was not captured if that was whatthe ussians aimed athe explanation of this strange fact given by ussian militaryhistorians to the effect that utuzov hindered an attack is unfoundedfor we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking atyazma and arutinohy was the ussian armywhich with inferior forces had withstood theenemy in full strength at orodinodefeated at rasnoe and the erezinaby the disorganized crowds of the rench when it was numericallysuperiorf the aim of the ussians consisted in cutting off and capturingapoleon and his marshalsand that aim was not merely frustrated butall attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffledthen this lastperiod of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the rench to be aseries of victories and quite wrongly considered victorious by ussianhistorianshe ussian military historians in so far as they submit to claims oflogic must admit that conclusion and in spite of their lyricalrhapsodies about valor devotion and so forth must reluctantly admitthat the rench retreat from oscow was a series of victories forapoleon and defeats for utuzovut putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such aconclusion involves a contradiction since the series of renchvictories brought the rench complete destruction while the series ofussian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and theliberation of their countryhe source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historiansstudying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generalsfrom memoirs reports projects and so forth have attributed to thislast period of the war of  an aim that never existed namely that ofcutting off and capturing apoleon with his marshals and his armyhere never was or could have been such an aim for it would have beensenseless and its attainment quite impossiblet would have been senseless first because apoleons disorganized armywas flying from ussia with all possible speed that is to say wasdoing just what every ussian desired o what was the use of performingvarious operations on the rench who were running away as fast as theypossibly couldecondly it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whosewhole energy was directed to flighthirdly it would have been senseless to sacrifice ones own troops inorder to destroy the rench army which without external interferencewas destroying itself at such a rate that though its path was notblocked it could not carry across the frontier more than it actuallydid in ecember namely a hundredth part of the original armyourthly it would have been senseless to wish to take captive themperor kings and dukeswhose capture would have been in the highestdegree embarrassing for the ussians as the most adroit diplomatists ofthe time oseph de aistre and others recognized till more senselesswould have been the wish to capture army corps of the rench when ourown army had melted away to half before reaching rasnoe and a wholedivision would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners andwhen our men were not always getting full rations and the prisonersalready taken were perishing of hungerll the profound plans about cutting off and capturing apoleon and hisarmy were like the plan of a market gardener who when driving out ofhis garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted shouldrun to the gate and hit the cow on the head he only thing to be saidin excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry ut not eventhat could be said for those who drew up this project for it was notthey who had suffered from the trampled bedsut besides the fact that cutting off apoleon with his army would havebeen senseless it was impossiblet was impossible first becauseas experience shows that a threemilemovement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the planstheprobability of hichagov utuzov and ittgenstein effecting a junctionon time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount toimpossibility as in fact thought utuzov who when he received the planremarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield thedesired resultsecondly it was impossible because to paralyze the momentum with whichapoleons army was retiring incomparably greater forces than theussians possessed would have been requiredhirdly it was impossible because the military term to cut off has nomeaning ne can cut off a slice of bread but not an army o cut offan armyto bar its roadis quite impossible for there is alwaysplenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing canbe seen as the military scientists might convince themselves by theexample of rasnoe and of the erezina t is only possible to captureprisoners if they agree to be captured just as it is only possible tocatch a swallow if it settles on ones hand en can only be takenprisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy andtactics as the ermans did ut the rench troops quite rightly did notconsider that this suited them since death by hunger and cold awaitedthem in flight or captivity alikeourthly and chiefly it was impossible because never since the worldbegan has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtainedin  and the ussian army in its pursuit of the rench strained itsstrength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroyingitselfuring the movement of the ussian army from arutino to rasnoe it lostfifty thousand sick or stragglers that is a number equal to thepopulation of a large provincial town alf the men fell out of the armywithout a battlend it is of this period of the campaignwhen the army lacked boots andsheepskin coats was short of provisions and without vodka and wascamping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees offrost when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and therest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot bemaintained when men were taken into that region of death wherediscipline fails not for a few hours only as in a battle but formonths where they were every moment fighting death from hunger andcold when half the army perished in a single monthit is of thisperiod of the campaign that the historians tell us how iloradovichshould have made a flank march to such and such a place ormasov toanother place and hichagov should have crossed more than kneedeep insnow to somewhere else and how soandso routed and cut off therench and so on and so onhe ussians half of whom died did all that could and should have beendone to attain an end worthy of the nation and they are not to blamebecause other ussians sitting in warm rooms proposed that they shoulddo what was impossiblell that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between thefacts and the historical accounts only arises because the historiansdealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful wordsand sentiments of various generals and not the history of the eventso them the words of iloradovich seem very interesting and so do theirsurmises and the rewards this or that general received but the questionof those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in gravesdoes not even interest them for it does not come within the range oftheir investigationet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans andconsider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took adirect part in the events and all the questions that seemed insolubleeasily and simply receive an immediate and certain solutionhe aim of cutting off apoleon and his army never existed except in theimaginations of a dozen people t could not exist because it wassenseless and unattainablehe people had a single aim to free their land from invasion hat aimwas attained in the first place of itself as the rench ran away andso it was only necessary not to stop their flight econdly it wasattained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the rench andthirdly by the fact that a large ussian army was following the renchready to use its strength in case their movement stoppedhe ussian army had to act like a whip to a running animal nd theexperienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as amenace than to strike the running animal on the head     hen seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror substancesimilar to his own is perishing before his eyes ut when it is abeloved and intimate human being that is dying besides this horror atthe extinction of life there is a severance a

understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protractedgaze agreed atasha now said to herself that it would be dreadful ifhe always continued to suffer  said it then only because it would havebeen dreadful for him but he understood it differently e thought itwould be dreadful for me e then still wished to live and feared deathnd  said it so awkwardly and stupidly  did not say what

felt more in harmonywith one another than either of them felt with herself when alone feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them an exclusivefeeling of life being possible only in each

childhood of hermother her father and her daydreams and atasha who with a passivelack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life ofdevotion submission and the poetry of hristian selfsacrifice nowfeeling herself bound to rincess ary by affection learned to love herpast too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible toher he did not think of applying submission and selfabnegation to herown life for she was accustomed to seek other joys but she understoodand loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues orrincess ary listening to atashas tales of childhood and earlyyouth there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side oflife belief in life and its enjoymentust as before they never mentioned him so as not to lower as theythought their exalted feelings by words but this silence about him hadthe effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without beingconscious of itatasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they alltalked about her health and this pleased her ut sometimes she wassuddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness weaknessand loss of good looks and involuntarily she examined her bare armcarefully surprised at its thinness and in the morning noticed herdrawn and as it seemed to her piteous face in her glass t seemed toher that things must be so and yet it was dreadfully sadne day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breathnconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down andthen testing her strength ran upstairs again observing the resultnother time when she called unyasha her voice trembled so she calledagainthough she could hear unyasha comingcalled her in the deepchest tones in which she had been wont to sing and listened attentivelyto herselfhe did not know and would not have believed it but beneath the layerof slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable delicateyoung shoots of grass were already sprouting which taking root would socover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that itwould soon no longer be seen or noticed he wound had begun to healfrom withint the end of anuary rincess ary left for oscow and the countinsisted on atashas going with her to consult the doctors fter the encounter at yazma where utuzov had been unable to holdback his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy andso on the farther movement of the fleeing rench and of the ussianswho pursued them continued as far as rasnoe without a battle heflight was so rapid that the ussian army pursuing the rench could notkeep up with them cavalry and artillery horses broke down and theinformation received of the movements of the rench was never reliablehe men in the ussian army were so worn out by this continuous marchingat the rate of twentyseven miles a day that they could not go anyfastero realize the degree of exhaustion of the ussian army it is onlynecessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that while notlosing more than five thousand killed and wounded after arutino andless than a hundred prisoners the ussian army which left that place ahundred thousand strong reached rasnoe with only fifty thousandhe rapidity of the ussian pursuit was just as destructive to our armyas the flight of the rench was to theirs he only difference was thatthe ussian army moved voluntarily with no such threat of destructionas hung over the rench and that the sick renchmen were left behind inenemy hands while the sick ussians left behind were among their ownpeople he chief cause of the wastage of apoleons army was therapidity of its movement and a convincing proof of this is thecorresponding decrease of the ussian armyutuzov as far as was in his power instead of trying to check themovement of the rench as was desired in etersburg and by the ussianarmy generals directed his whole activity here as he had done atarutino and yazma to hastening it on while easing the movement of ourarmyut besides this since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of thearmy caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident anotherreason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to utuzovhe aim of the ussian army was to pursue the rench he road therench would take was unknown and so the closer our troops trod ontheir heels the greater distance they had to cover nly by following atsome distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the rench llthe artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements ofthe army and a lengthening of its marches whereas the only reasonableaim was to shorten those marches o that end utuzovs activity wasdirected during the whole campaign from oscow to ilnanot casually orintermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from itutuzov felt and knewnot by reasoning or science but with the whole ofhis ussian beingwhat every ussian soldier felt that the rench werebeaten that the enemy was flying and must be driven out but at thesame time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this marchthe rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the yearut to the generals especially the foreign ones in the ussian armywho wished to distinguish themselves to astonish somebody and for somereason to capture a king or a dukeit seemed that nowwhen any battlemust be horrible and senselesswas the very time to fight and conquersomebody utuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after anotherthey presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiersillshod insufficiently clad and half starvedwho within a month andwithout fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number and who atthe best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distancethan they had already traversed before they reached the frontierhis longing to distinguish themselves to maneuver to overthrow andto cut off showed itself particularly whenever the ussians stumbled onthe rench armyo it was at rasnoe where they expected to find one of the threerench columns and stumbled instead on apoleon himself with sixteenthousand men espite all utuzovs efforts to avoid that ruinousencounter and to preserve his troops the massacre of the broken mob ofrench soldiers by wornout ussians continued at rasnoe for threedaysoll wrote a disposition he first column will march to so and soetc nd as usual nothing happened in accord with the dispositionrince ugene of urttemberg fired from a hill over the rench crowdsthat were running past and demanded reinforcements which did notarrive he rench avoiding the ussians dispersed and hid themselvesin the forest by night making their way round as best they could andcontinued their flightiloradovich who said he did not want to know anything about thecommissariat affairs of his detachment and could never be found when hewas wantedthat chevalier sans peur et sans reproche  as he styledhimselfwho was fond of parleys with the rench sent envoys demandingtheir surrender wasted time and did not do what he was ordered to do night without fear and without reproach give you that column lads he said riding up to the troops andpointing out the rench to the cavalrynd the cavalry with spurs and sabers urging on horses that couldscarcely move trotted with much effort to the column presented to themthat is to say to a crowd of renchmen stark with cold frostbittenand starvingand the column that had been presented to them threw downits arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to dot rasnoe they took twentysix thousand prisoners several hundredcannon and a stick called a marshals staff and disputed as to whohad distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievementthough they much regretted not having taken apoleon or at least amarshal or a hero of some sort and reproached one another andespecially utuzov for having failed to do sohese men carried away by their passions were but blind tools of themost melancholy law of necessity but considered themselves heroes andimagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable deedhey blamed utuzov and said that from the very beginning of thecampaign he had prevented their vanquishing apoleon that he thought ofnothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the inenactories because he was comfortable there that at rasnoe he checkedthe advance because on learning that apoleon was there he had quitelost his head and that it was probable that he had an understandingwith apoleon and had been bribed by him and so on and so onot only did his contemporaries carried away by their passions talk inthis way but posterity and history have acclaimed apoleon as grandwhile utuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty dissolute weakold courtier and by ussians as something indefinitea sort of puppetuseful only because he had a ussian name n  and  utuzov was openly accused of blundering he mperorwas dissatisfied with him nd in a history recently written by order ofthe ighest uthorities it is said that utuzov was a cunning courtliar frightened of the name of apoleon and that by his blunders atrasnoe and the erezina he deprived the ussian army of the glory ofcomplete victory over the rench  istory of the year  he character of utuzov and reflections onthe unsatisfactory results of the battles at rasnoe by ogdanovichuch is the fate not of great men grands hommes whom the ussian minddoes not acknowledge but of those rare and always solitary individualswho discerning the will of rovidence submit their personal will toit he hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerningthe higher lawsor ussian historians strange and terrible to say apoleonthat mostinsignificant tool of history who never anywhere even in exile showedhuman dignityapoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm he isgrand ut utuzovthe man who from the beginning to the end of hisactivity in  never once swerving by word or deed from orodino toilna presented an example exceptional in history of selfsacrifice anda present consciousness of the future importance of what was happeningutuzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful and whenspeaking of him and of the year  they always seem a little ashamednd yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whoseactivity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim and it would bedifficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the willof the whole people till more difficult would it be to find aninstance in history of the aim of an historical personage being socompletely accomplished as that to which all utuzovs efforts weredirected in utuzov never talked of forty centuries looking down from theyramids of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland or of whathe intended to accomplish or had accomplished in general he saidnothing about himself adopted no pose always appeared to be thesimplest and most ordinary of men and said the simplest and mostordinary things e wrote letters to his daughters and to adame detael read novels liked the society of pretty women jested withgenerals officers and soldiers and never contradicted those who triedto prove anything to him hen ount ostopchin at the auza bridgegalloped up to utuzov with personal reproaches for having caused thedestruction of oscow and said ow was it you promised not to abandonoscow without a battle utuzov replied nd  shall not abandonoscow without a battle though oscow was then already abandoned henrakcheev coming to him from the mperor said that rmolov ought to beappointed chief of the artillery utuzov replied es  was justsaying so myself though a moment before he had said quite thecontrary hat did it matter to himwho then alone amid a senselesscrowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what washappeningwhat did it matter to him whether ostopchin attributed thecalamities of oscow to him or to himself till less could it matter tohim who was appointed chief of the artilleryot merely in these cases but continually did that old manwho byexperience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and thewords serving as their expression are not what move peopleuse quitemeaningless words that happened to enter his headut that man so heedless of his words did not once during the wholetime of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aimtoward which he moved throughout the whole war bviously in spite ofhimself in very diverse circumstances he repeatedly expressed his realthoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understoodeginning with the battle of orodino from which time his disagreementwith those about him began he alone said that the battle of orodinowas a victory and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches andreports up to the time of his death e alone said that the loss ofoscow is not the loss of ussia n reply to auristons proposal ofpeace he said here can be no peace for such is the peoples will ealone during the retreat of the rench said that all our maneuvers areuseless everything is being accomplished of itself better than we coulddesire that the enemy must be offered a golden bridge that neitherthe arutino the yazma nor the rasnoe battles were necessary thatwe must keep some force to reach the frontier with and that he wouldnot sacrifice a single ussian for ten renchmennd this courtier as he is described to us who lies to rakcheev toplease the mperor he aloneincurring thereby the mperorsdispleasuresaid in ilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier isuseless and harmfulor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of theevents is actionswithout the smallest deviationwere all directedto one and the same threefold end  to brace all his strength forconflict with the rench  to defeat them and  to drive them outof ussia minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our peopleand of our armyhis procrastinator utuzov whose motto was atience and ime thisenemy of decisive action gave battle at orodino investing thepreparations for it with unparalleled solemnity his utuzov who beforethe battle of usterlitz began said that it would be lost he alone incontradiction to everyone else declared till his death that orodinowas a victory despite the assurance of generals that the battle waslost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire afterwinning a battle was unprecedented e alone during the whole retreatinsisted that battles which were useless then should not be foughtand that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of ussiacrossedt is easy now to understand the significance of these eventsif onlywe abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims thatexisted only in the heads of a dozen individualsfor the events andresults now lie before usut how did that old man alone in opposition to the general opinionso truly discern the importance of the peoples view of the events thatin all his activity he was never once untrue to ithe source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of theevents then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed infull purity and strengthnly the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling causedthe people in so strange a manner contrary to the sars wish toselect himan old man in disfavorto be their representative in thenational war nd only that feeling placed him on that highest humanpedestal from which he the commanderinchief devoted all his powersnot to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity onthemhat simple modest and therefore truly great figure could not be castin the false mold of a uropean herothe supposed ruler of menthathistory has inventedo a lackey no man can be great for a lackey has his own conception ofgreatness he fifth of ovember was the first day of what is called the battle ofrasnoe oward eveningafter much disputing and many mistakes made bygenerals who did not go to their proper places and after adjutants hadbeen sent about with counterorderswhen it had become plain that theenemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be nobattle utuzov left rasnoe and went to obroe whither his headquartershad that day been transferredhe day was clear and frosty utuzov rode to obroe on his plump littlewhite horse followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals whowhispered among themselves behind his back ll along the road groups ofrench prisoners captured that day there were seven thousand of themwere crowding to warm themselves at campfires ear obroe an immensecrowd of tattered prisoners buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandagedin anything they had been able to get hold of were standing in the roadbeside a long row of unharnessed rench guns t the approach of thecommanderinchief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed onutuzov who wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoatthat bulged on his round shoulders moved slowly along the road on hiswhite horse ne of the generals was reporting to him where the guns andprisoners had been capturedutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general wassaying e screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazedattentively and fixedly at these prisoners who presented a speciallywretched appearance ost of them were disfigured by frostbitten nosesand cheeks and nearly all had red swollen and festering eyesne group of the rench stood close to the road and two of them one ofwhom had his face covered with sores were tearing a piece of raw fleshwith their hands here was something horrible and bestial in thefleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolentexpression with which after a glance at utuzov the soldier with thesores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doingutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers e puckered hisface screwed up his eyes and pensively swayed his head t anotherspot he noticed a ussian soldier laughingly patting a renchman on theshoulder saying something to him in a friendly manner and utuzov withthe same expression on his face again swayed his headhat were you saying he asked the general who continuing his reportdirected the commanderinchiefs attention to some standards capturedfrom the rench and standing in front of the reobrazhensk regimenth the standards said utuzov evidently detaching himself withdifficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied hime looked about him absently housands of eyes were looking at him fromall sides awaiting a word from hime stopped in front of the reobrazhensk regiment sighed deeply andclosed his eyes ne of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying thestandards to advance and surround the commanderinchief with themutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then submitting with evidentreluctance to the duty imposed by his position raised his head andbegan to speak  throng of officers surrounded him e lookedattentively around at the circle of officers recognizing several ofthem thank you all he said addressing the soldiers and then again theofficers n the stillness around him his slowly uttered words weredistinctly heard  thank you all for your hard and faithful servicehe victory is complete and ussia will not

lower thats it urrah lads he added addressingthe men with a rapid movement of his chinurrrah roared thousands of voiceshile the soldiers were shouting utuzov leaned forward in his saddleand bowed his head and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironicgleamou see brothers said he when the shouts had ceased and all atonce his voice and the expression of his face changed t was no longerthe commanderinchief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted totell his comrades something very importanthere was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of thesoldiers who moved that they might hear better what he was going tosayou see brothers  know its hard for you but it cant be helpedear up it wont be for long now ell see our visitors off and thenwell rest he sar wont forget

ourselves but now we may evenpity them hey are human beings too snt it so ladse looked around and in the direct respectful wondering gaze fixedupon him he read sympathy with what he had said is face grew brighterand brighter with an old mans mild smile which drew the corners of hislips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles e ceased speaking and bowedhis head as if in perplexityut after all who asked them here erves them right the bloodybastards he cried suddenly lifting his headnd flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first timeduring the whole campaign and left the broken ranks of the soldierslaughing joyfully and shouting urrahutuzovs words were hardly understood by the troops o one could haverepeated the field marshals address begun solemnly and then changinginto an old mans simplehearted talk but the hearty sincerity of thatspeech the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foeand consciousness of the justice of our cause exactly expressed by thatold mans goodnatured expletives was not merely understood but lay inthe soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and longsustained shouts fterwards when one of the generals addressed utuzovasking whether he wished his caleche to be sent for utuzov inanswering unexpectedly gave a sob being evidently greatly moved hen the troops reached their nights halting place on the

vanishing now trembling they were busy whispering somethinggladsome and mysterious to one another he rench army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematicalprogression and that crossing of the erezina about which so much hasbeen written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction and notat all the decisive episode of the campaign f so much has been andstill is written about the erezina on the rench side this is onlybecause at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their armyhad been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one momentinto a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory and on theussian side merely because in etersburgfar from the seat of waraplan again one of fuels had been devised to catch apoleon in astrategic trap at the erezina iver veryone assured himself that allwould happen according to plan and therefore insisted that it was justthe crossing of the erezina that destroyed the rench army n realitythe results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the renchinguns and men lostthan rasnoe had been as the figures showhe sole importance of the crossing of the erezina lies in the factthat it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans forcutting off the enemys retreat and the soundness of the only possibleline of actionthe one utuzov and the general mass of the armydemandednamely simply to follow the enemy up he rench crowd fledat a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed toreaching its goal t fled like a wounded animal and it was impossibleto block its path his was shown not so much by the arrangements itmade for crossing as by what took place at the bridges hen the bridgesbroke down unarmed soldiers people from oscow and women with childrenwho were

samepitiful plight would be on a lower level to claim a share in thenecessities of life he rench did not need to be informed of the factthat half the prisonerswith whom the ussians did not know what to doperished of cold and hunger despite their captors desire to save themthey felt that it could not be otherwise he most compassionate ussiancommanders those favorable to the renchand even the renchmen in theussian servicecould do nothing for the prisoners he rench perishedfrom the conditions to which the ussian army was itself exposed t wasimpossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and indispensablesoldiers to give to the rench who though not harmful or hated orguilty were simply unnecessary ome ussians even did that but theywere exceptionsertain destruction lay behind the rench but in front there was hopeheir ships had been burned there was no salvation save in collectiveflight and on that the whole strength of the rench was concentratedhe farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of theremnant especially after the erezina on which in consequence of theetersburg plan special hopes had been placed by the ussians and thekeener grew the passions of the ussian commanders who blamed oneanother and utuzov most of all nticipation that the failure of theetersburg erezina plan would be attributed to utuzov led todissatisfaction contempt and ridicule more and more stronglyexpressed he ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in arespectful form making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was toblame hey did not talk seriously to him when reporting to him orasking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettableformality but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him atevery turnecause they could not understand him all these people assumed that itwas useless to talk to the old man that he would never grasp theprofundity of their plans that he would answer with his phrases whichthey thought were mere phrases about a golden bridge about theimpossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalionsand so forth hey had heard all that before nd all he saidthat itwas necessary to await provisions

utuzovs this hichagov was the firstto meet utuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay n undressnaval uniform with a dirk and holding his cap under his arm he handedutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town he contemptuouslyrespectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage wasexpressed in the highest degree by the behavior of hichagov who knewof the accusations that were being directed against utuzovhen speaking to hichagov utuzov incidentally mentioned that thevehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at orisovhad been recovered and would be restored to himou mean to imply that  have nothing to eat out of n thecontrary  can supply you with everything even if you want to givedinner parties warmly replied hichagov who tried by every word hespoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined utuzov to beanimated by the same desireutuzov shrugging his shoulders replied with his subtle penetratingsmile  meant merely to say what  saidontrary to the mperors wish utuzov detained the greater part of thearmy at ilna hose about him said that he became extraordinarily slackand physically feeble during his stay in that town e

full parade uniform stood in front of the castle as well asa guard of honor of the emenov regiment courier who galloped to the castle in advance in a troyka with threefoamflecked horses shouted oming and onovnitsyn rushed into thevestibule to inform utuzov who was waiting in the hall porters littlelodge minute later the old mans large stout figure in fulldress uniformhis chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomachwaddled out into the porch e put on his hat with its peaks to thesides and holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effortsideways down the steps to the level of the street took in his hand thereport he had prepared for the mperorhere was running to and fro and whispering another troyka flewfuriously up and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh inwhich the figures of the mperor and olkonski could already bedescriedrom the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effecton the old general e carefully and hastily felt himself all overreadjusted his hat and pulling himself together drew himself up and atthe very moment when the mperor having alighted from the sleighlifted his eyes to him handed him the report and began speaking in hissmooth ingratiating voicehe mperor with a rapid glance scanned utuzov from head to footfrowned for an instant but immediately mastering himself went up to theold man extended his arms and embraced him nd this embrace too owingto a longstanding impression related to his innermost feelings had itsusual effect on utuzov and he gave a sobhe mperor greeted the officers and the emenov guard and againpressing the old mans hand went with him into the castlehen alone with the field marshal the mperor expressed hisdissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes madeat rasnoe and the erezina and informed him of his intentions for afuture campaign abroad utuzov made no rejoinder or remark he samesubmissive expressionless look with which he had listened to themperors commands on the field of usterlitz seven years before settledon his face nowhen utuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossingthe ballroom with his heavy waddling gait he was arrested by someonesvoice sayingour erene ighnessutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes ofount olstoy who stood before him holding a silver salver on which laya small object utuzov seemed not to understand what was expected ofhimuddenly he seemed to remember a scarcely perceptible smile flashedacross his puffy face and bowing low and respectfully he took theobject that lay on the salver t was the rder of t eorge of theirst lass ext day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the mperorhonored by his presence utuzov had received the rder of t eorge ofthe irst lass and the mperor showed him the highest honors buteveryone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him he proprietieswere observed and the mperor was the first to set that example buteverybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and goodfornothing hen utuzov conforming to a custom of atherines dayordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at themperors feet on his entering the ballroom the mperor made a wry faceand muttered something in which some people caught the words the oldcomedianhe mperors displeasure with utuzov was specially increased at ilnaby the fact that utuzov evidently could not or would not understand theimportance of the coming campaignhen on the following morning the mperor said to the officers assembledabout him ou have not only saved ussia you have saved urope theyall understood that the war was not endedutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion thatno fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of ussiabut could only spoil and lower the glorious position that ussia hadgained e tried to prove to the mperor the impossibility of levyingfresh troops spoke of the hardships already endured by the people ofthe possibility of failure and so forthhis being the field marshals frame of mind he was naturally regardedas merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending waro avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man the natural method wasto do what had been done with him at usterlitz and with arclay at thebeginning of the ussian campaignto transfer the authority to themperor himself thus cutting the ground from under the commander inchiefs feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of thechangeith this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its realstrength removed and transferred to the mperor oll onovnitsyn andrmolov received fresh appointments veryone spoke loudly of the fieldmarshals great weakness and failing healthis health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given toanother nd in fact his health was pooro naturally simply and graduallyjust as he had come from urkey tothe reasury in etersburg to recruit the militia and then to the armywhen he was needed therenow when his part was played out utuzovsplace was taken by a new and necessary performerhe war of  besides its national significance dear to every ussianheart was now to assume another a uropean significancehe movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by amovement of peoples from east to west and for this fresh war anotherleader was necessary having qualities and views differing fromutuzovs and animated by different motiveslexander  was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from eastto west and for the refixing of national frontiers as utuzov had beenfor the salvation and glory of ussiautuzov did not understand what urope the balance of power orapoleon meant e could not understand it or the representative ofthe ussian people after the enemy had been destroyed and ussia hadbeen liberated and raised to the summit of her glory there was nothingleft to do as a ussian othing remained for the representative of thenational war but to die and utuzov died s generally happens ierre did not feel the full effects of thephysical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until afterthey were over fter his liberation he reached rel and on the thirdday there when preparing to go to iev he fell ill and was laid up forthree months e had what the doctors termed bilious fever utdespite the fact that the doctors treated him bled him and gave himmedicines to drink he recoveredcarcely any impression was left on ierres mind by all that happenedto him from the time of his rescue till his illness e remembered onlythe dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy internal physicaldistress and pains in his feet and side e remembered a generalimpression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of beingworried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him healso remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses andabove all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that timen the day of his rescue he had seen the body of etya ostov hat sameday he had learned that rince ndrew after surviving the battle oforodino for more than a month had recently died in the ostovs houseat aroslavl and enisov who told him this news also mentioned elenesdeath supposing that ierre had heard of it long before ll this atthe time seemed merely strange to ierre he felt he could not grasp itssignificance ust then he was only anxious to get away as quickly aspossible from places where people were killing one another to somepeaceful refuge where he could recover himself rest and think over allthe strange new facts he had learned but on reaching rel heimmediately fell ill hen he came to himself after his illness he sawin attendance on him two of his servants erenty and aska who hadcome from oscow and also his cousin the eldest princess who had beenliving on his estate at lets and hearing of his rescue and illness hadcome to look after himt was only gradually during his convalescence that ierre lost theimpressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months andgot used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywheretomorrow that no one would deprive him of his warm bed and that hewould be sure to get his dinner tea and supper ut for a long time inhis dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity n thesame way little by little he came to understand the news he had beentold after his rescue about the death of rince ndrew the death ofhis wife and the destruction of the rench joyous feeling of freedomthat complete inalienable freedom naturalto man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside oscowfilled ierres soul during his convalescence e was surprised to findthat this inner freedom which was independent of external conditionsnow had as it were an additional setting of external liberty e wasalone in a strange town without acquaintances o one demanded anythingof him or sent him anywhere e had all he wanted the thought of hiswife which had been a continual torment to him was no longer theresince she was no moreh how good ow splendid said he to himself when a cleanly laidtable was moved up to him with savory beef tea or when he lay down forthe night on a soft clean bed or when he remembered that the rench hadgone and that his wife was no more h how good how splendidnd by old habit he asked himself the question ell and what thenhat am  going to do nd he immediately gave himself the answerell  shall live h how splendidhe very question that had formerly tormented him the thing he hadcontinually sought to findthe aim of lifeno longer existed for himnow hat search for the aim of life had not merely disappearedtemporarilyhe felt that it no longer existed for him and could notpresent itself again nd this very absence of an aim gave him thecomplete joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness atthis timee could not see an aim for he now had faithnot faith in any kind ofrule or words or ideas but faith in an everliving evermanifestod ormerly he had sought im in aims he set himself hat search foran aim had been simply a search for od and suddenly in his captivityhe had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what hisnurse had told him long ago that od is here and everywhere n hiscaptivity he had learned that in arataev od was greater more infiniteand unfathomable than in the rchitect of the niverse recognized by thereemasons e felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see intothe far distance finds what he sought at his very feet ll his life hehad looked over the heads of the men around him when he should havemerely looked in front of him without straining his eyesn the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutableinfinite something e had only felt that it must exist somewhere andhad looked for it n everything near and comprehensible he had onlywhat was limited petty commonplace and senseless e had equippedhimself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space wherepetty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to himgreat and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen nd such haduropean life politics reemasonry philosophy and philanthropyseemed to him ut even then at moments of weakness as he had accountedthem his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seenthe same pettiness worldliness and senselessness ow however he hadlearned to see the great eternal and infinite in everything andthereforeto see it and enjoy its contemplationhe naturally threwaway the telescope through which he had till now gazed over mens headsand gladly regarded the everchanging eternally great unfathomableand infinite life around him nd the closer he looked the more tranquiland happy he became hat dreadful question hat for which hadformerly destroyed all his mental edifices no longer existed for himo that question hat for a simple answer was now always ready inhis soul ecause there is a od that od without whose will not onehair falls from a mans head n external ways ierre had hardly changed at all n appearance he wasjust what he used to be s before he was absentminded and seemedoccupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special ofhis own he difference between his former and present self was thatformerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to himhe had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking todistinguish something at a distance t present he still forgot what wassaid to him and still did not see what was before his eyes but he nowlooked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at whatwas before him and listened to what was said though evidently seeingand hearing something quite different ormerly he had appeared to be akindhearted but unhappy man and so people had been inclined to avoidhim ow a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips andsympathy for others shone in his eyes with a questioning look as towhether they were as contented as he was and people felt pleased by hispresencereviously he had talked a great deal grew excited when he talked andseldom listened now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knewhow to listen so that people readily told him their most intimatesecretshe princess who had never liked ierre and had been particularlyhostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him afterthe old counts death now after staying a short time in relwhere shehad come intending to show ierre that in spite of his ingratitude sheconsidered it her duty to nurse himfelt to her surprise and vexationthat she had become fond of him ierre did not in any way seek herapproval he merely studied her with interest ormerly she had feltthat he regarded her with indifference and irony and so had shrunk intoherself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative sideof her nature but now he seemed to be trying to understand the mostintimate places of her heart and mistrustfully at first but afterwardsgratefully she let him see the hidden kindly sides of her characterhe most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence moresuccessfully evoking memories of the best times of her youth andshowing sympathy with them et ierres cunning consisted simply infinding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embitteredhard and in her own way proud princesses he is a very very kind man when he is not under the influence ofbad people but of people such as myself thought sheis servants tooerenty and askain their own way noticed the changethat had taken place in ierre hey considered that he had become muchsimpler erenty when he had helped him undress and wished him goodnight often lingered with his masters boots in his hands and clothesover his arm to see whether he would not start a talk nd ierrenoticing that erenty wanted a chat generally kept him thereell tell me now how did you get food he would asknd erenty would begin talking of the destruction of oscow and of theold count and would stand for a long time holding the clothes andtalking or sometimes listening to ierres stories and then would goout into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master andaffection for himhe doctor who attended ierre and visited him every day though heconsidered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every momentwas of value to suffering humanity would sit for hours with ierretelling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on thecharacters of his patients in general and especially of the ladiests a pleasure to talk to a man like that he is not like ourprovincials he would sayhere were several prisoners from the rench army in rel and thedoctor brought one of them a young talian to see ierrehis officer began visiting ierre and the princess used to make fun ofthe tenderness the talian expressed for himhe talian seemed happy only when he could come to see ierre talkwith him tell him about his past his life at home and his love andpour out to him his indignation against the rench and especiallyagainst apoleonf all ussians are in the least like you it is sacrilege to fightsuch a nation he said to ierre ou who have suffered so from therench do not even feel animosity toward themierre had evoked the passionate affection of the talian merely byevoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doinguring the last days of ierres stay in rel his old masonicacquaintance ount illarski who had introduced him to the lodge in came to see him illarski was married to a ussian heiress whohad a large estate in rel province and he occupied a temporary post inthe commissariat department in that townearing that ezukhov was in rel illarski though they had never beenintimate came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacythat people who meet in a desert generally express for one anotherillarski felt dull in rel and was pleased to meet a man of his owncircle and as he supposed of similar interestsut to his surprise illarski soon noticed that ierre had lagged muchbehind the times and had sunk as he expressed it to himself intoapathy and egotismou are letting yourself go my dear fellow he saidut for all that illarski found it pleasanter now than it had beenformerly to be with ierre and came to see him every day o ierre ashe looked at and listened to illarski it seemed strange to think thathe had been like that himself but a short time beforeillarski was a married man with a family busy with his family affairshis wifes affairs and his official duties e regarded all theseoccupations as hindrances to life and considered that they were allcontemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and hisfamily ilitary administrative political and masonic interestscontinually absorbed his attention nd ierre without trying to changethe others views and without condemning him but with the quietjoyful and amused smile now habitual to him was interested in thisstrange though very familiar phenomenonhere was a new feature in ierres relations with illarski with theprincess with the doctor and with all the people he now met whichgained for him the general good will his was his acknowledgment of theimpossibility of changing a mans convictions by words and hisrecognition of the possibility of everyone thinking feeling and seeingthings each from his own point of view his legitimate peculiarity ofeach individual which used to excite and irritate ierre now became abasis of the sympathy he felt for and the interest he took in otherpeople he difference and sometimes complete contradiction betweenmens opinions and their lives and between one man and another pleasedhim and drew from him an amused and gentle smilen practical matters ierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center ofgravity he had previously lacked ormerly all pecuniary questionsespecially requests for money to which as an extremely wealthy man hewas very exposed produced in him a state of hopeless agitation andperplexity o give or not to give he had asked himself  have itand he needs it ut someone else needs it still more ho needs itmost nd perhaps they are both impostors n the old days he had beenunable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all whoasked as long as he had anything to give ormerly he had been in asimilar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning hisproperty when one person advised one thing and another something elseow to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt orperplexity about these questions here was now within him a judge whoby some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be donee was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters but now he feltcertain of what ought and what ought not to be done he first time hehad recourse to his new judge was when a rench prisoner a colonelcame to him and after talking a great deal about his exploitsconcluded by making what amounted to a demand that ierre should givehim four thousand francs to send to his wife and children ierrerefused without the least difficulty or effort and was afterwardssurprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear soinsurmountably difficult t the same time that he refused the colonelsdemand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice whenleaving rel to induce the talian officer to accept some money ofwhich he was evidently in need  further proof to ierre of his ownmore settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decisionwith regard to his wifes debts and to the rebuilding of his houses inand near oscowis head steward came to him at rel and ierre reckoned up with him hisdiminished income he burning of oscow had cost him according to thehead stewards calculation about two million rubleso console ierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimateshowing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished butwould even be increased if he refused to pay his wifes debts which hewas under no obligation to meet and did not rebuild his oscow houseand the country house on his oscow estate which had cost him eightythousand rubles a year and brought in nothinges of course thats true said ierre with a cheerful smile dont need all that at all y being ruined  have become much richerut in anuary avelich came from oscow and gave him an account of thestate of things there and spoke of the estimate an architect had madeof the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses speaking of thisas of a settled matter bout the same time he received letters fromrince asili and other etersburg acquaintances speaking of his wifesdebts nd ierre decided that the stewards proposals which had sopleased him were wrong and that he must go to etersburg and settle hiswifes affairs and must rebuild in oscow hy this was necessary he didnot know but he knew for certain that it was necessary is incomewould be reduced by three fourths but he felt it must be doneillarski was going to oscow and they agreed to travel togetheruring the whole time of his convalescence in rel ierre hadexperienced a feeling of joy freedom and life but when during hisjourney he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of newfaces that feeling was intensified hroughout his journey he felt likea schoolboy on holiday veryonethe stagecoach driver the posthouseoverseers the peasants on the roads and in the villageshad a newsignificance for him he presence and remarks of illarski whocontinually deplored the ignorance and poverty of ussia and itsbackwardness compared with urope only heightened ierres pleasurehere illarski saw deadness ierre saw an extraordinary strength andvitalitythe strength which in that vast space amid the snowsmaintained the life of this original peculiar and unique people edid not contradict illarski and even seemed to agree with himanapparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions thatcould lead to nothingand he smiled joyfully as he listened to him t would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap hasbeen destroyed are hurrying some from the heap dragging bits ofrubbish larvae and corpses others back to the heap or why theyjostle overtake one another and fight and it would be equallydifficult to explain what caused the ussians after the departure of therench to throng to the place that had formerly been oscow ut when wewatch the ants round their ruined heap the tenacity energy andimmense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destructionof the heap something indestructible which though intangible is thereal strength of the colony still exists and similarly though inoscow in the month of ctober there was no government and no churchesshrines riches or housesit was still the oscow it had been inugust ll was destroyed except something intangible yet powerful andindestructiblehe motives of those who thronged from all sides to oscow after it hadbeen cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal and at firstfor the most part savage and brutal ne motive only they all had incommon a desire to get to the place that had been called oscow toapply their activities thereithin a week oscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants in afortnight twentyfive thousand and so on y the autumn of  thenumber ever increasing and increasing exceeded what it had been inhe first ussians to enter oscow were the ossacks of intzingerodesdetachment peasants from the adjacent villages and residents who hadfled from oscow and had been hiding in its vicinity he ussians whoentered oscow finding it plundered plundered it in their turn heycontinued what the rench had begun rains of peasant carts came tooscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in theruined houses and the streets he ossacks carried off what they couldto their camps and the householders seized all they could find in otherhouses and moved it to their own pretending that it was their propertyut the first plunderers were followed by a second and a thirdcontingent and with increasing numbers plundering became more and moredifficult and assumed more definite formshe rench found oscow abandoned but with all the organizations ofregular life with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship withluxury and governmental and religious institutions hese forms werelifeless but still existed here were bazaars shops warehousesmarket stalls granariesfor the most part still stocked with goodsand there were factories and workshops palaces and wealthy housesfilled with luxuries hospitals prisons government offices churchesand cathedrals he longer the rench remained the more these forms oftown life perished until finally all was merged into one confusedlifeless scene of plunderhe more the plundering by the rench continued the more both thewealth of oscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed utplundering by the ussians with which the reoccupation of the citybegan had an opposite effect the longer it continued and the greaterthe number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealthof the city and its regular life restoredesides the plunderers very various people some drawn by curiositysome by official duties some by selfinteresthouse owners clergyofficials of all kinds tradesmen artisans and peasantsstreamed intooscow as blood flows to the heartithin a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry

remlinothers insisted that as the rench had gathered things from differenthouses into this or that house it would be unfair to allow its owner tokeep all that was found there hey abused the police and bribed themmade out estimates at ten times their value for government stores thathad perished in the fire and demanded relief nd ount ostopchinwrote proclamations t the end of anuary ierre went to oscow and stayed in an annex ofhis house which had not been burned e called on ount ostopchin andon some acquaintances who were back in oscow and he intended to leavefor etersburg two days later verybody was celebrating the victoryeverything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving cityveryone was pleased to see ierre everyone wished to meet him andeveryone questioned him about what he had seen ierre felt particularlywell disposed toward them all but was now instinctively on his guardfor fear of binding himself in any way o all questions put to himwhether important or quite triflingsuch as here would he live ashe going to rebuild hen was he going to etersburg and would he mindtaking a parcel for someonehe replied es perhaps or  thinkso and so one had heard that the ostovs were at ostroma but the thought ofatasha seldom occurred to him f it did it was only as a pleasantmemory of the distant past e felt himself not only free from socialobligations but also from that feeling which it seemed to him he hadaroused in himselfn the third day after his arrival he heard from the rubetskoys thatrincess ary was in oscow he death sufferings and last days ofrince ndrew had often occupied ierres thoughts and now recurred tohim with fresh vividness aving heard at dinner that rincess ary wasin oscow and living in her housewhich had not been burnedinozdvizhenka treet he drove that same evening to see hern his way to the house ierre kept thinking of rince ndrew of theirfriendship of his various meetings with him and especially of the lastone at orodinos it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then ins it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him beforehe died thought ierre e recalled arataev and his death andinvoluntarily began to compare these two men so different and yet sosimilar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love hefelt for both of themierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious moodhe house had escaped the fire it showed signs of damage but itsgeneral aspect was unchanged he old footman who met ierre with astern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence ofthe old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the houseinformed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments and thatshe received on undaysnnounce me erhaps she will see me said ierrees sir said the man lease step into the portrait gallery few minutes later the footman returned with essalles who broughtword from the princess that she would be very glad to see ierre if hewould excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartmentn a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with heranother person dressed in black ierre remembered that the princessalways had lady companions but who they were and what they were like henever knew or remembered his must be one of her companions hethought glancing at the lady in the black dresshe princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her handes she said looking at his altered face after he had kissed herhand so this is how we meet again e spoke of you even at the verylast she went on turning her eyes from ierre to her companion with ashyness that surprised him for an instant was so glad to hear of your safety t was the first piece of goodnews we had received for a long timegain the princess glanced round at her companion with even moreuneasiness in her manner and was about to add something but ierreinterrupted herust imagine knew nothing about him said he  thought he hadbeen killed ll  know  heard at second hand from others  only knowthat he fell in with the ostovs hat a strange coincidenceierre spoke rapidly and with animation e glanced once at thecompanions face saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him andas often happens when one is talking felt somehow that this companionin the black dress was a good kind excellent creature who would nothinder his conversing freely with rincess aryut when he mentioned the ostovs rincess arys face expressed stillgreater embarrassment he again glanced rapidly from ierres face tothat of the lady in the black dress and saido you really not recognize herierre looked again at the companions pale delicate face with itsblack eyes and peculiar mouth and something near to him long forgottenand more than sweet looked at him from those attentive eyesut no it cant be he thought his stern thin pale face thatlooks so much older t cannot be she t merely reminds me of her utat that moment rincess ary said atasha nd with difficultyeffort and stress like the opening of a door grown rusty on itshinges a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes and fromthat opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused ierre witha happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even beenthinkingespecially at that moment t suffused him seized him andenveloped him completely hen she smiled doubt was no longer possibleit was atasha and he loved hert that moment ierre involuntarily betrayed to her to rincess aryand above all to himself a secret of which he himself had been unawaree flushed joyfully yet with painful distress e tried to hide hisagitation ut the more he tried to hide it the more clearlyclearerthan any words could have donedid he betray to himself to her and torincess ary that he loved hero its only the unexpectedness of it thought ierre ut as soon ashe tried to continue the conversation he had begun with rincess ary heagain glanced at atasha and a stilldeeper flush suffused his face anda stillstronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul ebecame confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he wassayingierre had failed to notice atasha because he did not at all expect tosee her there but he had failed to recognize her because the change inher since he last saw her was immense he had grown thin and pale butthat was not what made her unrecognizable she was unrecognizable at themoment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone witha suppressed smile of the joy of life now when he first entered andglanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile only her eyeswere kindly attentive and sadly interrogativeierres confusion was not reflected by any confusion on atashas partbut only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face he has come to stay with me said rincess ary he count andcountess will be here in a few days he countess is in a dreadfulstate but it was necessary for atasha herself to see a doctor heyinsisted on her coming with mees is there a family free from sorrow now said ierre addressingatasha ou know it happened the very day we were rescued  saw himhat a delightful boy he wasatasha looked at him and by way of answer to his words her eyeswidened and lit uphat can one say or think of as a consolation said ierre othinghy had such a splendid boy so full of life to diees in these days it would be hard to live without faith remarkedrincess aryes yes that is really true ierre hastily interrupted herhy is it true atasha asked looking attentively into ierres eyesow can you ask why said rincess ary he thought alone of whatawaitsatasha without waiting for rincess ary to finish again lookedinquiringly at ierrend because ierre continued only one who believes that there is aod ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and yoursatasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stoppedierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed rincess aryasking about his friends last daysierres confusion had now almost vanished but at the same time he feltthat his freedom had also completely gone e felt that there was now ajudge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to himthan that of all the rest of the world s he spoke now he wasconsidering what impression his words would make on atasha e did notpurposely say things to please her but whatever he was saying heregarded from her standpointrincess aryreluctantly as is usual in such casesbegan telling ofthe condition in which she had found rince ndrew ut ierres facequivering with emotion his questions and his eager restless expressiongradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recallfor her own sakees yes and so ierre kept saying as he leaned toward her withhis whole body and eagerly listened to her story es yes so hegrew tranquil and softened ith all his soul he had always sought onethingto be perfectly goodso he could not be afraid of death hefaults he hadif he had anywere not of his making o he didsoften hat a happy thing that he saw you again he added suddenlyturning to atasha and looking at her with eyes full of tearsatashas face twitched he frowned and lowered her eyes for a momenthe hesitated for an instant whether to speak or notes that was happiness she then said in her quiet voice with itsdeep chest notes or me it certainly was happiness he paused ndhe he he said he was wishing for it at the very moment  enteredthe roomatashas voice broke he blushed pressed her clasped hands on herknees and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted herhead and began to speak rapidlye knew nothing of it when we started from oscow  did not dare toask about him hen suddenly onya told me he was traveling with us had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in all  wanted wasto see him and be with him she said trembling and breathing quicklynd not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she hadnever yet mentioned to anyoneall she had lived through during thosethree weeks of their journey and life at aroslavlierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full oftears s he listened he did not think of rince ndrew nor of deathnor of what she was telling e listened to her and felt only pity forher for what she was suffering now while she was speakingrincess ary frowning in her effort to hold back her tears sat besideatasha and heard for the first time the story of those last days ofher brothers and atashas lovevidently atasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful talehe spoke mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets ofher soul and it seemed as if she could never finish everal times sherepeated the same thing twiceessalles voice was heard outside the door asking whether littleicholas might come in to say good nightell thats alleverything said atashahe got up quickly just as icholas entered almost ran to the doorwhich was hidden by curtains struck her head against it and rushedfrom the room with a moan either of pain or sorrowierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did notunderstand why he suddenly felt all alone in the worldrincess ary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attentionto her nephew who had entered the roomt that moment of emotional tenderness young icholas face whichresembled his fathers affected ierre so much that when he had kissedthe boy he got up quickly took out his handkerchief and went to thewindow e wished to take leave of rincess ary but she would not lethim goo atasha and  sometimes dont go to sleep till after two so pleasedont go  will order supper o downstairs we will come immediatelyefore ierre left the room rincess ary told him his is the firsttime she has talked of him like that ierre was shown into the large brightly lit dining room a few minuteslater he heard footsteps and rincess ary entered with atasha atashawas calm though a severe and grave expression had again settled on herface hey all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardnesswhich usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk t isimpossible to go back to the same conversation to talk of trifles isawkward and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems likeaffectation hey went silently to table he footmen drew back thechairs and pushed them up again ierre unfolded his cold table napkinand resolving to break the silence looked at atasha and at rincessary hey had evidently both formed the same resolution the eyes ofboth shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow lifealso has joyo you take vodka ount asked rincess ary and those wordssuddenly banished the shadows of the past ow tell us about yourselfsaid she ne hears such improbable wonders about youes replied ierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to himhey even tell me wonders  myself never dreamed of ary bramovnainvited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened or oughtto have happened to me tepan tepanych also instructed me how  oughtto tell of my experiences n general  have noticed that it is veryeasy to be an interesting man  am an interesting man now peopleinvite me out and tell me all about myselfatasha smiled and was on the point of speakinge have been told rincess ary interrupted her that you lost twomillions in oscow s that trueut  am three times as rich as before returned ierrehough the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wifesdebts and to rebuild his houses ierre still maintained that he hadbecome three times as rich as beforehat  have certainly gained is freedom he began seriously but didnot continue noticing that this theme was too egotisticnd are you buildinges avelich says  mustell me you did not know of the countess death when you decided toremain in oscow asked rincess ary and immediately blushed noticingthat her question following his mention of freedom ascribed to hiswords a meaning he had perhaps not intendedo answered ierre evidently not considering awkward the meaningrincess ary had given to his words  heard of it in rel and youcannot imagine how it shocked me e were not an exemplary couple headded quickly glancing at atasha and noticing on her face curiosity asto how he would speak of his wife but her death shocked me terriblyhen two people quarrel they are always both in fault and ones ownguilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longeralive nd then such a death without friends and without consolation am very very sorry for her he concluded and was pleased to noticea look of glad approval on atashas facees and so you are once more an eligible bachelor said rincessaryierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look atatasha hen he ventured to glance her way again her face was coldstern and he fancied even contemptuousnd did you really see and speak to apoleon as we have been toldsaid rincess aryierre laughedo not once verybody seems to imagine that being taken prisonermeans being apoleons guest ot only did  never see him but  heardnothing about him was in much lower companyupper was over and ierre who at first declined to speak about hiscaptivity was gradually led on to do sout its true that you remained in oscow to kill apoleon atashaasked with a slight smile  guessed it then when we met at theukharev tower do you rememberierre admitted that it was true and from that was gradually led byrincess arys questions and especially by atashas into giving adetailed account of his adventurest first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with himtoward everybody and especially toward himself but when he came todescribe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he wasunconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressedemotion of a man reexperiencing in recollection strong impressions hehas lived throughrincess ary with a gentle smile looked now at ierre and now atatasha n the whole narrative she saw only ierre and his goodnessatasha leaning on her elbow the expression of her face constantlychanging with the narrative watched ierre with an attention that neverwanderedevidently herself experiencing all that he described ot onlyher look but her exclamations and the brief questions she put showedierre that she understood just what he wished to convey t was clearthat she understood not only what he said but also what he wished tobut could not express in words he account ierre gave of the incidentwith the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested wasthis t was an awful sightchildren abandoned some in the flamesne was snatched out before my eyes and there were women who hadtheir things snatched off and their earrings torn out he flushed andgrew confused hen a patrol arrived and all the menall those whowere not looting that iswere arrested and  among them am sure youre not telling us everything  am sure you didsomething said atasha and pausing added something fineierre continued hen he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass overthe horrible details but atasha insisted that he should not omitanythingierre began to tell about arataev but paused y this time he hadrisen from the table and was pacing the room atasha following him withher eyes hen he addedo you cant understand what  learned from that illiterate manthatsimple fellowes yes go on said atasha here is hehey killed him almost before my eyesnd ierre his voice trembling continually went on to tell of the lastdays of their retreat of arataevs illness and his deathe told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them e now asit were saw a new meaning in all he had gone through ow that he wastelling it all to atasha he experienced that pleasure which a man haswhen women listen to himnot clever women who when listening either tryto remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunityoffers to retell it or who wish to adopt it to some thought of theirown and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in theirlittle mental workshopbut the pleasure given by real women gifted witha capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himselfatasha without knowing it was all attention she did not lose a wordno single quiver in ierres voice no look no twitch of a muscle inhis face nor a single gesture he caught the unfinished word in itsflight and took it straight into her open heart divining the secretmeaning of all ierres mental travailrincess ary understood his story and sympathized with him but she nowsaw something else that absorbed all her attention he saw thepossibility of love and happiness between atasha and ierre and thefirst thought of this filled her heart with gladnesst was three oclock in the morning he footmen came in with sad andstern faces to change the candles but no one noticed themierre finished his story atasha continued to look at him intentlywith bright attentive and animated eyes as if trying to understandsomething more which he had perhaps left untold ierre in shamefacedand happy confusion glanced occasionally at her and tried to think whatto say next to introduce a fresh subject rincess ary was silent toccurred to none of them that it was three oclock and time to go tobedeople speak of misfortunes and sufferings remarked ierre but ifat this moment  were asked ould you rather be what you were beforeyou were taken prisoner or go through all this again then forheavens sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh e imaginethat when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost but it isonly then that what is new and good begins hile there is life there ishappiness here is much much before us  say this to you he addedturning to atashaes yes she said answering something quite different  too shouldwish nothing but to relive it all from the beginningierre looked intently at heres and nothing more said atashats not true not true cried ierre  am not to blame for beingalive and wishing to livenor you eitheruddenly atasha bent her head covered her face with her hands andbegan to cryhat is it atasha said rincess aryothing nothing he smiled at ierre through her tears ood nightt is time for bedierre rose and took his leaverincess ary and atasha met as usual in the bedroom hey talked ofwhat ierre had told them rincess ary did not express her opinion ofierre nor did atasha speak of himell good night ary said atasha o you know  am often afraidthat by not speaking of him she meant rince ndrew for fear of notdoing justice to our feelings we forget himrincess ary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice ofatashas remark but she did not express agreement in wordss it possible to forget said shet did me so much good to tell all about it today t was hard andpainful but good very good said atasha  am sure he really lovedhim hat is why  told him as it all right she added suddenlyblushingo tell ierre h yes hat a splendid man he is said rincessaryo you know ary atasha suddenly said with a mischievous smilesuch as rincess ary had not seen on her face for a long time he hassomehow grown so clean smooth and freshas if he had just come out ofa ussian bath do you understand ut of a moral bath snt it truees replied rincess ary e has greatly improvedith a short coat and his hair cropped just as if well just as if hehad come straight from the bath apa used to understand why he rince ndrew liked no one so much as himsaid rincess aryes and yet he is quite different hey say men are friends when theyare quite different hat must be true eally he is quite unlike himin everythinges but hes wonderfulell good night said atashand the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face asif it had been forgotten there t was a long time before ierre could fall asleep that night e pacedup and down his room now turning his thoughts on a difficult problemand frowning now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing and nowsmiling happilye was thinking of rince ndrew of atasha and of their love at onemoment jealous of her past then reproaching himself for that feelingt was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down theroomell whats to be done if it cannot be avoided hats to be donevidently it has to be so said he to himself and hastily undressinghe got into bed happy and agitated but free from hesitation orindecisiontrange and impossible as such happiness seems  must do everythingthat she and  may be man and wife he told himself few days previously ierre had decided to go to etersburg on theriday hen he awoke on the hursday avelich came to ask him aboutpacking for the journeyhat to etersburg hat is etersburg ho is there in etersburghe asked involuntarily though only to himself h yes long agobefore this happened  did for some reason mean to go to etersburg hereflected hy ut perhaps  shall go hat a good fellow he is andhow attentive and how he remembers everything he thought looking atavelichs old face and what a pleasant smile he hasell avelich do you still not wish to accept your freedom ierreasked himhats the good of freedom to me your excellency e lived under thelate countthe kingdom of heaven be hisand we have lived under youtoo without ever being wrongednd your childrenhe children will live just the same ith such masters one can liveut what about my heirs said ierre upposing  suddenly marryit might happen he added with an involuntary smilef  may take the liberty your excellency it would be a good thingow easy he thinks it thought ierre e doesnt know how terribleit is and how dangerous oo soon or too late it is terribleo what are your orders re you starting tomorrow asked avelicho ll put it off for a bit ll tell you later ou must forgivethe trouble  have put you to said ierre and seeing avelich smilehe thought ut how strange it is that he should not know that nowthere is no etersburg for me and that that must be settled first ofall ut probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending hall have a talk with him and see what he thinks ierre reflected oanother timet breakfast ierre told the princess his cousin that he had been tosee rincess ary the day before and had there methom do you thinkatasha ostovahe princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if hehad seen nna emenovnao you know her asked ierre have seen the princess she replied  heard that they werearranging a match for her with young ostov t would be a very goodthing for the ostovs they are said to be utterly ruinedo  mean do you know atasha ostova heard about that affair of hers at the time t was a great pityo she either doesnt understand or is pretending thought ierreetter not say anything to her eitherhe princess too had prepared provisions for ierres journeyow kind they all are thought ierre hat is surprising is thatthey should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be ofinterest to them nd all for men the same day the hief of olice came to ierre inviting him to senda representative to the aceted alace to recover things that were to bereturned to their owners that daynd this man too thought ierre looking into the face of the hiefof olice hat a fine goodlooking officer and how kind ancybothering about such trifles now nd they actually say he is not honestand takes bribes hat nonsense esides why shouldnt he take bribeshats the way he was brought up and everybody does it ut what akind pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at meierre went to rincess arys to dinners he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burneddown he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins he picturesquenessof the chimney stacks and tumbledown walls of the burnedout quartersof the town stretching out and concealing one another reminded him ofthe hine and the olosseum he cabmen he met and their passengers thecarpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes the womenhawkers and the shopkeepers all looked at him with cheerful beamingeyes that seemed to say h there he is ets see what will come ofitt the entrance to rincess arys house ierre felt doubtful whether hehad really been there the night before and really seen atasha andtalked to her erhaps  imagined it perhaps  shall go in and find noone there ut he had hardly entered the room before he felt herpresence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom hewas in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done thesame way as the day before yet she was quite different ad she beenlike this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment havefailed to recognize herhe was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as rincendrews fiancee  bright questioning light shone in her eyes and onher face was a friendly and strangely roguish expressionierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there butrincess ary was going to vespers and ierre left the house with herext day he came early dined and stayed the whole evening houghrincess ary and atasha were evidently glad to see their visitor andthough all ierres interest was now centered in that house by theevening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed fromone trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off e stayed so longthat rincess ary and atasha exchanged glances evidently wonderingwhen he would go ierre noticed this but could not go e felt uneasyand embarrassed but sat on because he simply could not get up and takehis leaverincess ary foreseeing no end to this rose first and complaining ofa headache began to say good nighto you are going to etersburg tomorrow she askedo  am not going ierre replied hastily in a surprised tone and asthough offended es no to etersburg omorrowbut  wont saygoodby yet  will call round in case you have any commissions for mesaid he standing before rincess ary and turning red but not takinghis departureatasha gave him her hand and went out rincess ary on the other handinstead of going away sank into an armchair and looked sternly andintently at him with her deep radiant eyes he weariness she hadplainly shown before had now quite passed off ith a deep and longdrawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talkhen atasha left the room ierres confusion and awkwardnessimmediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement e quicklymoved an armchair toward rincess aryes  wanted to tell you said he answering her look as if she hadspoken rincess help me hat am  to do an  hope rincess mydear friend listen  know it all  know  am not worthy of her know its impossible to speak of it now ut  want to be a brother toher o not that  dont  cante paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his handsell he went on with an evident effort at selfcontrol and coherence dont know when  began to love her but  have loved her and heralone all my life and  love her so that  cannot imagine life withouther  cannot propose to her at present but the thought that perhapsshe might someday be my wife and that  may be missing thatpossibility that possibility is terrible ell me can  hopeell me what  am to do dear princess he added after a pause andtouched her hand as she did not reply am thinking of what you have told me answered rincess ary hisis what  will say ou are right that to speak to her of love atpresentrincess ary stopped he was going to say that to speak of love wasimpossible but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change inatasha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if ierrespoke of his love but that it was the very thing she wished foro speak to her now wouldnt do said the princess all the sameut what am  to doeave it to me said rincess ary  knowierre was looking into rincess arys eyesell ell he said know that she loves will love you rincess ary correctedherselfefore her words were out ierre had sprung up and with a frightenedexpression seized rincess arys handhat makes you think so ou think  may hope ou thinkes  think so said rincess ary with a smile rite to herparents and leave it to me  will tell her when  can  wish it tohappen and my heart tells me it willo it cannot be ow happy  am ut it cant be ow happy  amo it cant be ierre kept saying as he kissed rincess arys handso to etersburg that will be best nd  will write to you shesaido etersburg o there ery well ll go ut  may come againtomorrowext day ierre came to say goodby atasha was less animated than shehad been the day before but that day as he looked at her ierresometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor sheexisted any longer that nothing existed but happiness s it possibleo it cant be he told himself at every look gesture and word thatfilled his soul with joyhen on saying goodby he took her thin slender hand he could not helpholding it a little longer in his owns it possible that this hand that face those eyes all this treasureof feminine charm so strange to me now is it possible that it will oneday be mine forever as familiar to me as  am to myself o thatsimpossibleoodbye ount she said aloud  shall look forward very much toyour return she added in a whispernd these simple words her look and the expression on her face whichaccompanied them formed for two months the subject of inexhaustiblememories interpretations and happy meditations for ierre  shalllook forward very much to your return es yes how did she say ites  shall look forward very much to your return h how happy am hat is happening to me ow happy  am said ierre to himself here was nothing in ierres soul now at all like what had troubled itduring his courtship of elenee did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the wordshe had spoken or say h why did  not say that and hatever mademe say e vous aime n the contrary he now repeated in imaginationevery word that he or atasha had spoken and pictured every detail ofher face and smile and did not wish to diminish or add anything butonly to repeat it again and again here was now not a shadow of doubtin his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrongnly one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind asnt it all adream snt rincess ary mistaken m  not too conceited and selfconfident  believe all thisand suddenly rincess ary will tell herand she will be sure to smile and say ow strange e must be deludinghimself oesnt he know that he is a man just a man while   amsomething altogether different and higherhat was the only doubt often troubling ierre e did not now make anyplans he happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if onlyhe could attain it it would be the end of all things verything endedwith that joyful unexpected frenzy of which he had thought himself incapablepossessed him he whole meaning of lifenot for him alone but for thewhole worldseemed to him centered in his love and the possibility ofbeing loved by her t times everybody seemed to him to be occupied withone thing onlyhis future happiness ometimes it seemed to him thatother people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried tohide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests nevery word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness e oftensurprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles whichseemed to express a secret understanding between him and them nd whenhe realized that people might not be aware of his happiness he pitiedthem with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to themthat all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy ofattentionhen it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service orwhen the war or any general political affairs were discussed on theassumption that everybodys welfare depended on this or that issue ofevents he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprisepeople by his strange comments ut at this time he saw everybodyboththose who as he imagined understood the real meaning of life that iswhat he was feeling and those unfortunates who evidently did notunderstand itin the bright light of the emotion that shone withinhimself and at once without any effort saw in everyone he meteverything that was good and worthy of being lovedhen dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife her memoryaroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss henow knew rince asili who having obtained a new post and some freshdecorations was particularly proud at this time seemed to him apathetic kindly old man much to be pitiedften in afterlife ierre recalled this period of blissful insanity llthe views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained truefor him always e not only did not renounce them subsequently but whenhe was in doubt or inwardly at variance he referred to the views he hadheld at this time of his madness and they always proved correct may have appeared strange and queer then he thought but  was notso mad as  seemed n the contrary  was then wiser and had moreinsight than at any other time and understood all that is worthunderstanding in life because because  was happyierres insanity consisted in not waiting as he used to do todiscover personal attributes which he termed good qualities in peoplebefore loving them his heart was now overflowing with love and byloving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for lovingthem fter ierres departure that first evening when atasha had said torincess ary with a gaily mocking smile e looks just yes just asif he had come out of a ussian bathin a short coat and with his haircropped something hidden and unknown to herself but irrepressibleawoke in atashas soulverything her face walk look and voice was suddenly altered oher own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to thesurface and demanded satisfaction rom that evening she seemed to haveforgotten all that had happened to her he no longer complained of herposition did not say a word about the past and no longer feared tomake happy plans for the future he spoke little of ierre but whenrincess ary mentioned him a longextinguished light once more kindledin her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smilehe change that took place in atasha at first surprised rincess arybut when she understood its meaning it grieved her an she have lovedmy brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon she thoughtwhen she reflected on the change ut when she was with atasha she wasnot vexed with her and did not reproach her he reawakened power oflife that had seized atasha was so evidently irrepressible andunexpected by her that in her presence rincess ary felt that she hadno right to reproach her even in her heartatasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling thatshe did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad but brightand cheerfulhen rincess ary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk withierre atasha met her on the thresholde has spoken es e has spoken she repeatednd a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness forher joy settled on atashas face wanted to listen at the door but  knew you would tell menderstandable and touching as the look with which atasha gazed at herseemed to rincess ary and sorry as she was to see her agitationthese words pained her for a moment he remembered her brother and hisloveut whats to be done he cant help it thought the princessnd with a sad and rather stern look she told atasha all that ierrehad said n hearing that he was going to etersburg atasha wasastoundedo etersburg she repeated as if unable to understandut noticing the grieved expression on rincess arys face she guessedthe reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cryary said she tell me what  should do  am afraid of being badhatever you tell me  will do ell meou love himes whispered atashahen why are you crying  am happy for your sake said rincess arywho because of those tears quite forgave atashas joyt wont be just yetsomeday hink what fun it will be when  am hiswife and you marry icholasatasha  have asked you not to speak of that et us talk about youhey were silent awhileut why go to etersburg atasha suddenly asked and hastily repliedto her own question ut no no he must es ary e must     even years had passed he stormtossed sea of uropean history hadsubsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm ut themysterious forces that move humanity mysterious because the laws oftheir motion are unknown to us continued to operatehough the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless the movementof humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time arious groupsof people formed and dissolved the coming formation and dissolution ofkingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparationhe sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore aspreviously t was seething in its depths istoric figures were notborne by the waves from one shore to another as before hey now seemedto rotate on one spot he historical figures at the head of armies whoformerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering warscampaigns and battles now reflected the restless movement by politicaland diplomatic combinations laws and treatieshe historians call this activity of the historical figures thereactionn dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historicalpersonages who in their opinion caused what they describe as thereaction ll the wellknown people of that period from lexander andapoleon to adame de tael hotius chelling ichte hateaubriandand the rest pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted orcondemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reactionccording to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in ussiaalso and the chief culprit was lexander  the same man who accordingto them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencementof his reign being the savior of ussiahere is no one in ussian literature now from schoolboy essayist tolearned historian who does not throw his little stone at lexander forthings he did wrong at this period of his reigne ought to have acted in this way and in that way n this case he didwell and in that case badly e behaved admirably at the beginning ofhis reign and during  but acted badly by giving a constitution tooland forming the oly lliance entrusting power to rakcheevfavoring olitsyn and mysticism and afterwards hishkov and hotius ealso acted badly by concerning himself with the active army anddisbanding the emenov regimentt would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches thehistorians address to him based on their knowledge of what is good forhumanityhat do these reproaches meano not the very actions for which the historians praise lexander  theliberal attempts at the beginning of his reign his struggle withapoleon the firmness he displayed in  and the campaign of flow from the same sourcesthe circumstances of his birth educationand lifethat made his personality what it was and from which theactions for which they blame him the oly lliance the restoration ofoland and the reaction of  and later also flowedn what does the substance of those reproaches liet lies in the fact that an historic character like lexander standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with theblinding light of history focused upon him a character exposed to thosestrongest of all influences the intrigues flattery and selfdeceptioninseparable from power a character who at every moment of his life felta responsibility for all that was happening in urope and not afictitious but a live character who like every man had his personalhabits passions and impulses toward goodness beauty and truththatthis characterthough not lacking in virtue the historians do notaccuse him of thathad not the same conception of the welfare ofhumanity fifty years ago as a presentday professor who from his youthupwards has been occupied with learning that is with books andlectures and with taking notes from themut even if we assume that fifty years ago lexander  was mistaken inhis view of what was good for the people we must inevitably assume thatthe historian who judges lexander will also after the lapse of sometime turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanityhis assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because watchingthe movement of history we see that every year and with each newwriter opinion as to what is good for mankind changes so that whatonce seemed good ten years later seems bad and vice versa nd what ismore we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as towhat is bad and what is good in history some people regard giving aconstitution to oland and forming the oly lliance as praiseworthy inlexander while others regard it as blameworthyhe activity of lexander or of apoleon cannot be called useful orharmful for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmfulf that activity displeases somebody this is only because it does notagree with his limited understanding of what is good hether thepreservation of my fathers house in oscow or the glory of the ussianarms or the prosperity of the etersburg and other universities or thefreedom of oland or the greatness of ussia or the balance of power inurope or a certain kind of uropean culture called progress appearto me to be good or bad  must admit that besides these things theaction of every historic character has other more general purposesinaccessible to meut let us assume that what is called science can harmonize allcontradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad bywhich to try historic characters and events let us say that lexandercould have done everything differently let us say that with guidancefrom those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of themovement of humanity he might have arranged matters according to theprogram his present accusers would have given himof nationalityfreedom equality and progress these  think cover the ground etus assume that this program was possible and had then been formulatedand that lexander had acted on it hat would then have become of theactivity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed inthe governmentan activity that in the opinion of the historians wasgood and beneficent heir activity would not have existed there wouldhave been no life there would have been nothingf we admit that human life can be ruled by reason the possibility oflife is destroyed f we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to theattainment of certain endsthe greatness of ussia or of rance thebalance of power in urope the diffusion of the ideas of theevolution general progress or anything elsethen it is impossible toexplain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions ofchance and geniusf the aim of the uropean wars at the beginning of the nineteenthcentury had been the aggrandizement of ussia that aim might have beenaccomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion fthe aim was the aggrandizement of rance that might have been attainedwithout the evolution and without the mpire f the aim was thedissemination of ideas the printing press could have accomplished thatmuch better than warfare f the aim was the progress of civilizationit is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilizationmore expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human liveshy did it happen in this and not in some other wayecause it happened so hance created the situation genius utilizedit says historyut what is chance hat is geniushe words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing andtherefore cannot be defined hose words only denote a certain stage ofunderstanding of phenomena  do not know why a certain event occurs think that  cannot know it so  do not try to know it and  talk aboutchance  see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinaryhuman agencies  do not understand why this occurs and  talk ofgeniuso a herd of rams the ram the herdsman drives each evening into aspecial enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the othersmust seem to be a genius nd it must appear an astonishing conjunctionof genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ramwho instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into aspecial enclosure where there are oatsthat this very ram swellingwith fat is killed for meatut the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to themhappens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims they need onlyadmit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their kenand they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened tothe ram that was fattened ven if they do not know for what purposethey are fattened they will at least know that all that happened to theram did not happen accidentally and will no longer need the conceptionsof chance or geniusnly by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediatelyintelligible to us and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond ourken may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historiccharacters and perceive the cause of the effect they produceincommensurable with ordinary human capabilities and then the wordschance and genius become superfluouse need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the uropeanconvulsions and that we know only the factsthat is the murders firstin rance then in taly in frica in russia in ustria in painand in ussiaand that the movements from the west to the east and fromthe east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events andnot only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius inapoleon and lexander but we shall be unable to consider them to beanything but like other men and we shall not be obliged to haverecourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which madethese people what they were but it will be clear that all those smallevents were inevitabley discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose we shallclearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed forany single plant better suited to it than those it produces so it isimpossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to thesmallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill than apoleon andlexander with all their antecedents he fundamental and essential significance of the uropean events of thebeginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass ofthe uropean peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to westhe commencement of that movement was the movement from west to eastor the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement tooscow it was necessary  that they should form themselves into amilitary group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlikemilitary group of the east  that they should abandon all establishedtraditions and customs and  that during their military movement theyshould have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to themthe deceptions robberies and murders which would have to be committedduring that movementnd beginning with the rench evolution the old inadequately largegroup was destroyed as well as the old habits and traditions and stepby step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs andtraditions and a man was produced who would stand at the head of thecoming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done man without convictions without habits without traditions without aname and not even a renchman emergesby what seem the strangestchancesfrom among all the seething rench parties and without joiningany one of them is borne forward to a prominent positionhe ignorance of his colleagues the weakness and insignificance of hisopponents the frankness of his falsehoods and the dazzling and selfconfident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the army hebrilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to taly hisopponents reluctance to fight and his own childish audacity and selfconfidence secure him military fame nnumerable socalled chancesaccompany him everywhere he disfavor into which he falls with therulers of rance turns to his advantage is attempts to avoid hispredestined path are unsuccessful he is not received into the ussianservice and the appointment he seeks in urkey comes to nothing uringthe war in taly he is several times on the verge of destruction andeach time is saved in an unexpected manner wing to various diplomaticconsiderations the ussian armiesjust those which might have destroyedhis prestigedo not appear upon the scene till he is no longer theren his return from taly he finds the government in aris in a processof dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped outand destroyed nd by chance an escape from this dangerous positionpresents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition tofrica gain socalled chance accompanies him mpregnable altasurrenders without a shot his most reckless schemes are crowned withsuccess he enemys fleet which subsequently did not let a single boatpass allows his entire army to elude it n frica a whole series ofoutrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants nd themen who commit these crimes especially their leader assure themselvesthat this is admirable this is gloryit resembles aesar and lexanderthe reat and is therefore goodhis ideal of glory and grandeurwhich consists not merely inconsidering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on everycrime one commits ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernaturalsignificancethat ideal destined to guide this man and his associateshad scope for its development in frica hatever he does succeeds heplague does not touch him he cruelty of murdering prisoners is notimputed to him as a fault is childishly rash uncalledfor andignoble departure from frica leaving his comrades in distress is setdown to his credit and again the enemys fleet twice lets him slippast hen intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfullyhe reaches aris the dissolution of the republican government which ayear earlier might have ruined him has reached its extreme limit andhis presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements canonly serve to exalt himand though he himself has no plan he is quiteready for his new rolee had no plan he was afraid of everything but the parties snatched athim and demanded his participatione alonewith his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in taly andgypt his insane selfadulation his boldness in crime and frankness inlyinghe alone could justify what had to be donee is needed for the place that awaits him and so almost apart from hiswill and despite his indecision his lack of a plan and all hismistakes he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power andthe conspiracy is crowned with successe is pushed into a meeting of the legislature n alarm he wishes toflee considering himself lost e pretends to fall into a swoon andsays senseless things that should have ruined him ut the once proudand shrewd rulers of rance feeling that their part is played out

what would happen if he lived another year that heunexpectedly diedicholas was with the ussian army in aris when the news of hisfathers death reached him e at once resigned his commission andwithout waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went tooscow he state of the counts affairs became quite obvious a monthafter his death surprising everyone by the immense total of small debtsthe existence of which no one had suspected he debts amounted todouble the value of the propertyriends and relations advised icholas to decline the inheritance uthe regarded such a refusal as a slur on his fathers memory which heheld sacred and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted theinheritance together with the obligation to pay the debtshe creditors who had so long been silent restrained by a vague butpowerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the countscareless good nature all proceeded to enforce their claims at once salways happens in such cases rivalry

icholas tried to hide his wretched condition from himis position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelvehundred rubles he had not only to keep himself his mother and onyabut had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty hecountess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions shehad been used to from childhood and unable to realize how hard it wasfor her

himself irredeemably indebted toonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired herpatience and devotion but tried to keep aloof from here seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect andbecause there was nothing to reproach her with he had all that peopleare valued for but little that could have made him love her e feltthat the more he valued her the less he loved her e had taken her ather word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if allthat had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never inany case be renewedicholas position became worse and worse he idea of putting somethingaside out of his salary proved a dream ot only did he not saveanything but to comply with his mothers demands he even incurred somesmall debts e could see no way out of this situation he idea ofmarrying some rich woman which was suggested to him by his femalerelations was repugnant to him he other way outhis mothers deathnever entered his head e wished for nothing and hoped for nothing anddeep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in anuncomplaining endurance of his position e tried to avoid his oldacquaintances with their commiseration and offensive offers ofassistance he avoided all distraction and recreation and even at homedid nothing but play cards with his mother pace silently up and downthe room and smoke one pipe after another e seemed carefully tocherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endurehis position t the beginning of winter rincess ary came to oscow rom reportscurrent in town she learned how the ostovs were situated and how theson has sacrificed himself for his mother as people were saying never expected anything else of him said rincess ary to herselffeeling a joyous sense of her love for him emembering her friendlyrelations with all the ostovs which had made her almost a member of thefamily she thought it her duty to go to see them ut remembering herrelations with icholas in oronezh she was shy about doing so aking agreat effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after herarrival in oscowicholas was the first to meet her as the countess room could only bereached through his ut instead of being greeted with pleasure as shehad expected at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold stiffproud expression she had not seen on it before e inquired about herhealth led the way to his mother and having sat there for five minutesleft the roomhen the princess came out of the countess room icholas met her againand with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroomo her remarks about his mothers health he made no reply hats thatto you eave me in peace his looks seemed to sayhy does she come prowling here hat does she want  cant bear theseladies and all these civilities said he aloud in onyas presenceevidently unable to repress his vexation after the princess carriagehad disappearedh icholas how can you talk like that cried onya hardly able toconceal her delight he is so kind and amma is so fond of hericholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess anymore ut after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times adayhe sang her praises insisted that her son must call on her expresseda wish to see her often but yet always became illhumored when shebegan to talk about hericholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princessbut his silence irritated herhe is a very admirable and excellent young woman said she and youmust go and call on her ou would at least be seeing somebody and think it must be dull for you only seeing usut  dont in the least want to ammaou used to want to and now you dont eally  dont understand youmy dear ne day you are dull and

have asked you and now  wont interfere any more since youhave secrets from your motherell then ll go if you wish itt doesnt matter to me  only wish it for your sakeicholas sighed bit his mustache and laid out the cards for apatience trying to divert his mothers attention to another topiche same conversation was repeated next day and the day after and theday after thatfter her visit to the ostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reception byicholas rincess ary confessed to herself that she had been right innot wishing to be the first to call expected nothing else she told herself calling her pride to heraid  have nothing to do with him and  only wanted to see the oldlady who was always kind to me and to whom  am under manyobligationsut she could not pacify herself with these reflections a feeling akinto remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit hough she hadfirmly resolved not to call on the ostovs again and to forget the wholematter she felt herself all the time in an awkward position nd whenshe asked herself what distressed her she had to admit that it was herrelation to ostov is cold polite manner did not express his feelingfor her she knew that but it concealed something and until she coulddiscover what that something was she felt that she could not be ateasene day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to hernephews lessons she was informed that ostov had called ith a firmresolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation she sentfor ademoiselle ourienne and went with her to the drawing roomer first glance at icholas face told her that he had only come tofulfill the demands of politeness and she firmly resolved to maintainthe tone in which he addressed herhey spoke of the countess health of their mutual friends of thelatest war news and when the ten minutes required by propriety hadelapsed after which a visitor may rise icholas got up to say goodbyith ademoiselle ouriennes help the princess had maintained theconversation very well but at the very last moment just when he roseshe was so tired of talking of what did not interest her and her mindwas so full of the question why she alone was granted so littlehappiness in life that in a fit of absentmindedness she sat still herluminous eyes gazing fixedly before her not noticing that he had risenicholas glanced at her and wishing to appear not to notice herabstraction made some remark to ademoiselle ourienne and then againlooked at the princess he still sat motionless with a look ofsuffering on her gentle face e suddenly felt sorry for her and wasvaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her faceexpressed e wished to help her and say something pleasant but couldthink of nothing to sayoodbye rincess said hehe started flushed and sighed deeplyh  beg your pardon she said as if waking up re you goingalready ount ell then goodby h but the cushion for thecountessait a moment ll fetch it said ademoiselle ourienne and sheleft the roomhey both sat silent with an occasional glance at one anotheres rincess said icholas at last with a sad smile it doesntseem long ago since we first met at ogucharovo but how much water hasflowed since then n what distress we all seemed to be then yet would give much to bring back that time but theres no bringing itbackrincess ary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones ashe said this he seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning ofhis words which would explain his feeling for heres yes said she but you have no reason to regret the past ounts  understand your present life  think you will always recall itwith satisfaction because the selfsacrifice that fills it now cannot accept your praise he interrupted her hurriedly n thecontrary  continually reproach myself ut this is not at all aninteresting or cheerful subjectis face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression ut theprincess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved and itwas to him that she now spoke thought you would allow me to tell you this she said  had comeso near to you and to all your family that  thought you would notconsider my sympathy misplaced but  was mistaken and suddenly hervoice trembled  dont know why she continued recovering herselfbut you used to be different andhere are a thousand reasons why laying special emphasis on the whyhank you rincess he added softly ometimes it is hardo thats why hats why a voice whispered in rincess arys soulo it was not only that gay kind and frank look not only thathandsome exterior that  loved in him  divined his noble resoluteselfsacrificing spirit too she said to herself es he is poor nowand  am rich es thats the only reason es were it not forthat nd remembering his former tenderness and looking now at hiskind sorrowful face she suddenly understood the cause of his coldnessut why ount why she almost cried unconsciously moving closer tohim hy ell me ou must tell mee was silent dont understand your why ount she continued but its hard forme  confess it or some reason you wish to deprive me of our formerfriendship nd that hurts me here were tears in her eyes and in hervoice  have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hardfor me to bear xcuse me goodby and suddenly she began to cryand was hurrying from the roomrincess for ods sake he exclaimed trying to stop herrincesshe turned round or a few seconds they gazed silently into oneanothers eyesand what had seemed impossible and remote suddenlybecame possible inevitable and very near n the winter of  icholas married rincess ary and moved to aldills with his wife his mother and onyaithin four years he had paid off all his remaining debts withoutselling any of his wifes property and having received a smallinheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to ierre as welln another three years by  he had so managed his affairs that hewas able to buy a small estate adjoining ald ills and was negotiatingto buy back tradnoethat being his pet dreamaving started farming from necessity he soon grew so devoted to itthat it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation icholas wasa plain farmer he did not like innovations especially the nglish onesthen coming into vogue e laughed at theoretical treatises on estatemanagement disliked factories the raising of expensive products andthe buying of expensive seed corn and did not make a hobby of anyparticular part of the work on his estate e always had before hisminds eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it hechief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil nor the oxygenin the air nor manures nor special plows but that most importantagent by which nitrogen oxygen manure and plow were made effectivethe peasant laborer hen icholas first began farming and began tounderstand its different branches it was the serf who especiallyattracted his attention he peasant seemed to him not merely a toolbut also a judge of farming and an end in himself t first he watchedthe serfs trying to understand their aims and what they considered goodand bad and only pretended to direct them and give orders while inreality learning from them their methods their manner of speech andtheir judgment of what was good and bad nly when he had understood thepeasants tastes and aspirations had learned to talk their language tograsp the hidden meaning of their words and felt akin to them did hebegin boldly to manage his serfs that is to perform toward them theduties demanded of him nd icholas management produced very brilliantresultsuided by some gift of insight on taking up the management of theestates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff village elder anddelegate the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had theyhad the right to choose and these posts never changed hands eforeanalyzing the properties of manure before entering into the debit andcredit as he ironically called it he found out how many cattle thepeasants had and increased the number by all possible means e kept thepeasant families together in the largest groups possible not allowingthe family groups to divide into separate households e was hard alikeon the lazy the depraved and the weak and tried to get them expelledfrom the communee was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants hay andcorn as of his own and few landowners had their crops sown andharvested so early and so well or got so good a return as didicholase disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfsthe dronesas he called themand everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity hena decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf especially if onehad to be punished he always felt undecided and consulted everybody inthe house but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscriptedinstead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation enever felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants e knew that hisevery decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptionse did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man or tomake things easy for or reward anyone merely because he felt inclinedto do so e could not have said by what standard he judged what heshould or should not do but the standard was quite firm and definite inhis own mindften speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity he wouldsay hat can one do with our ussian peasants and imagined that hecould not bear themet he loved our ussian peasants and their way of life with his wholesoul and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the oneway and manner of farming which produced good resultsountess ary was jealous of this passion of her husbands and regrettedthat she could not share it but she could not understand the joys andvexations he derived from that world to her so remote and alien hecould not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy whenafter getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in thefields or on the threshing floor he returned from the sowing or mowingor reaping to have tea with her he did not understand why he spokewith such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and welltodo peasant atthew rmishin who with his family had carted corn allnight or of the fact that his icholas sheaves were already stackedbefore anyone else had his harvest in he did not understand why hestepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustacheand winked so joyfully when warm steady rain began to fall on the dryand thirsty shoots of the young oats or why when the wind carried awaya threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from thebarn flushed sunburned and perspiring with a smell of wormwood andgentian in his hair and gleefully rubbing his hands would say ellone more day and my grain and the peasants will all be under covertill less did she understand why he kindhearted and always ready toanticipate her wishes should become almost desperate when she broughthim a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her tobe excused some work why he that kind icholas should obstinatelyrefuse her angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not herbusiness he felt he had a world apart which he loved passionately andwhich had laws she had not fathomedometimes when trying to understand him she spoke of the good

neighborhat  want is that our children should not have to go begging  mustput our affairs in order while  am alive thats all nd to do thatorder and strictness are essential hats all about it said heclenching his vigorous fist nd fairness of course he added forif the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse hecan do no good either for himself or for mend all icholas did was fruitfulprobably just because he refused toallow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtuessake is means increased rapidly serfs from neighboring estates cameto beg him to buy them and long after his death the memory of hisadministration was devoutly preserved among the serfs e was amaster the peasants affairs first and then his own f course he wasnot to be trifled with eitherin a word he was a real master ne matter connected with his management sometimes worried icholas andthat was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of makingfree use of his fists t first he saw nothing reprehensible in thisbut in the second year of his marriage his view of that form ofpunishment suddenly changednce in summer he had sent for the village elder from ogucharovo a manwho had succeeded to the post when ron died and who was accused ofdishonesty and various irregularities icholas went out into the porchto question him and immediately after the elder had given a few repliesthe sound of cries and blows were heard n returning to lunch icholaswent up to his wife who sat with her head bent low over her embroideryframe and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing thatmorning mong other things he spoke of the ogucharovo elder ountessary turned red and then pale but continued to sit with head bowed andlips compressed and gave her husband no replyuch an insolent scoundrel he cried growing hot again at the mererecollection of him f he had told me he was drunk and did not seeut what is the matter with you ary he suddenly askedountess ary raised her head and tried to speak but hastily lookeddown again and her lips puckeredhy whatever is the matter my dearesthe looks of the plain ountess ary always improved when she was intears he never cried from pain or vexation but always from sorrow orpity and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charmhe moment icholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herselfand began to cryicholas  saw it he was to blame but why do you icholas andshe covered her face with her handsicholas said nothing e flushed crimson left her side and paced upand down the room e understood what she was weeping about but couldnot in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded fromchildhood as quite an everyday event was wrong s it justsentimentality old wives tales or is she right he asked himselfefore he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled withlove and pain and he suddenly realized that she was right and that hehad long been sinning against himselfary he said softly going up to her it will never happen again give you my word ever he repeated in a trembling voice like a boyasking for forgivenesshe tears flowed faster still from the countess eyes he took his handand kissed iticholas when did you break your cameo she asked to change thesubject looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo ofaocoons headodayit was the same affair h ary dont remind me of it andagain he flushed  give you my word of honor it shant occur againand let this always be a reminder to me and he pointed to the brokenringfter that when in discussions with his village elders or stewards theblood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench icholas wouldturn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before theman who was making him angry ut he did forget himself once or twicewithin a twelvemonth and then he would go and confess to his wife andwould again promise that this should really be the very last timeary you must despise me he would say  deserve itou should go go away at once if you dont feel strong enough tocontrol yourself she would reply sadly trying to comfort her husbandmong the gentry of the province icholas was respected but not likede did not concern himself with the interests of his own class andconsequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid hewhole summer from spring sowing to harvest

sure it is ierre  will go and see said ountess ary and leftthe roomn her absence icholas allowed himself to give his little daughter agallop round the room ut of breath he took the laughing child quicklyfrom his shoulder and pressed her to his heart is capers reminded himof dancing and looking at the childs round happy little face hethought of what she would be like when he was an old man taking herinto society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father haddanced aniel ooper with his daughtert is he it is he icholas said ountess ary reentering the rooma few minutes later ow our atasha has come to life ou should haveseen her ecstasy and how he caught it for having stayed away so longell come along now quick quick ts time you two were parted sheadded looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her fathericholas went out holding the child by the handountess ary remained in the sitting room should never never have believed that one could be so happy shewhispered to herself  smile lit up her face but at the same time shesighed and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she feltthrough her happiness that there is another sort of happinessunattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at thatinstant atasha had married in the early spring of  and in  already hadthree daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she wasnow nursing he had grown stouter and broader so that it was difficultto recognize in this robust motherly woman the slim lively atasha offormer days er features were more defined and had a calm soft andserene expression n her face there was none of the everglowinganimation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm owher face and body were often all that one saw and her soul was notvisible at all ll that struck the eye was a strong handsome andfertile woman he old fire very rarely kindled in her face now hathappened only when as was the case that day her husband returned homeor a sick child was convalescent or when she and ountess ary spoke ofrince ndrew she never mentioned him to her husband who she imaginedwas jealous of rince ndrews memory or on the rare occasions whensomething happened to induce her to sing a practice she had quiteabandoned since her marriage t the rare moments when the old fire didkindle in her handsome fully developed body she was even moreattractive than in former daysince their marriage atasha and her husband had lived in oscow inetersburg on their estate near oscow or with her mother that is tosay in icholas house he young ountess ezukhova was not often seenin society and those who met her there were not pleased with her andfound her neither attractive nor amiable ot that atasha likedsolitudeshe did not know whether she liked it or not she even thoughtthat she did notbut with her pregnancies her confinements thenursing of her children and sharing every moment of her husbands lifeshe had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncingsociety ll who had known atasha before her marriage wondered at thechange in her as at something extraordinary nly the old countess withher maternal instinct had realized that all atashas outbursts had beendue to her need of children and a husbandas she herself had onceexclaimed at tradnoe not so much in fun as in earnestand her motherwas now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had neverunderstood atasha and she kept saying that she had always known thatatasha would make an exemplary wife and mothernly she lets her love of her husband and children overflow allbounds said the countess so that it even becomes absurdatasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folkespecially by the rench which says that a girl should not let herselfgo when she marries should not neglect her accomplishments should beeven more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried andshould fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became herhusband atasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witcheryof which her singing had been an unusually powerful part he gave it upjust because it was so powerfully seductive he took no pains with hermanners or with delicacy of speech or with her toilet or to showherself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes or to avoidinconveniencing him by being too exacting he acted in contradiction toall those rules he felt that the allurements instinct had formerlytaught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of herhusband to whom she had from the first moment given herself upentirelythat is with her whole soul leaving no corner of it hiddenfrom him he felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained bythe poetic feelings that had attracted him to her but by somethingelseindefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soulo fluff out her curls put on fashionable dresses and sing romanticsongs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adornherself to attract herself o adorn herself for others might perhapshave been agreeableshe did not knowbut she had no time at all forit he chief reason for devoting no time either to singing to dressor to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare forthese thingse know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in asubject however trivial it may be and that there is no subject sotrivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if ones entireattention is devoted to ithe subject which wholly engrossed atashas attention was her familythat is her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belongentirely to her and to the home and the children whom she had to bearbring into the world nurse and bring upnd the deeper she penetrated not with her mind only but with her wholesoul her whole being into the subject that absorbed her the largerdid that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powersappear so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yetwas unable to accomplish all that she considered necessaryhere were then as now conversations and discussions about womensrights the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rightsthough these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now butthese topics were not merely uninteresting to atasha she positivelydid not understand themhese questions then as now existed only for those who see nothing inmarriage but the pleasure married people get from one another that isonly the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance whichlies in the familyiscussions and questions of that kind which are like the question ofhow to get the greatest gratification from ones dinner did not thenand do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is thenourishment it affords and the purpose of marriage is the familyf the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body a man who eats twodinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain hispurpose for his stomach will not digest the two dinnersf the purpose of marriage is the family the person who wishes to havemany wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure but in thatcase will not have a familyf the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is thefamily the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than onecan digest and not having more wives or husbands than are needed forthe familythat is one wife or one husband atasha needed a husband husband was given her and he gave her a family nd she not only sawno need of any other or better husband but as all the powers of hersoul were intent on serving that husband and family she could notimagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things weredifferentatasha did not care for society in general but prized the more thesociety of her relativesountess ary and her brother her motherand onya he valued the company of those to whom she could comestriding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown and withjoyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on babys napkin andfrom whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby wasmuch bettero such an extent had atasha let herself go that the way she dressedand did her hair her illchosen words and her jealousyshe wasjealous of onya of the governess and of every woman pretty or plainwere habitual subjects of jest to those about her he general opinionwas that ierre was under his wifes thumb which was really true romthe very first days of their married life atasha had announced herdemands ierre was greatly surprised by his wifes view to him aperfectly novel one that every moment of his life belonged to her andto the family is wifes demands astonished him but they alsoflattered him and he submitted to themierres subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared notflirt with but dared not even speak smilingly to any other woman didnot dare dine at the club as a pastime did not dare spend money on awhim and did not dare absent himself for any length of time except onbusinessin which his wife included his intellectual pursuits whichshe did not in the least understand but to which she attributed greatimportance o make up for this at home ierre had the right toregulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose thome atasha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husbandand the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupiedthat iswas reading or writing in his study ierre had but to show a partialityfor anything to get just what he liked done always e had only toexpress a wish and atasha would jump up and run to fulfill ithe entire household was governed according to ierres supposed ordersthat is by his wishes which atasha tried to guess heir way of lifeand place of residence their acquaintances and ties atashasoccupations the childrens upbringing were all selected not merelywith regard to ierres expressed wishes but to what atasha from thethoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be nd shededuced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly and having oncearrived at them clung to them tenaciously hen ierre himself wanted tochange his mind she would fight him with his own weaponshus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of theirfirst child who was delicate when they had to change the wet nursethree times and atasha fell ill from despair ierre one day told herof ousseaus view with which he quite agreed that to have a wet nurseis unnatural and harmful hen her next baby was born despite theopposition of her mother the doctors and even of her husband himselfwho were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself a thingthen unheard of and considered injuriousshe insisted on having her ownway and after that nursed all her babies herselft very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wifewould have a dispute but long afterwards ierre to his surprise anddelight would find in his wifes ideas and actions the very thoughtagainst which she had argued but divested of everything superfluousthat in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing hisopinionfter seven years of marriage ierre had the joyous and firmconsciousness that he was not a bad man and he felt this because he sawhimself reflected in his wife e felt the good and bad within himselfinextricably mingled and overlapping ut only what was really good inhim was reflected in his wife all that was not quite good was rejectednd this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct andmysterious reflection wo months previously when ierre was already staying with the ostovshe had received a letter from rince heodore asking him to come toetersburg to confer on some important questions that were beingdiscussed there by a society of which ierre was one of the principalfoundersn reading that letter she always read her husbands letters atashaherself suggested that he should go to etersburg though she would feelhis absence very acutely he attributed immense importance to all herhusbands intellectual and abstract interests though she did notunderstand them and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in suchmatters o ierres timid look of inquiry after reading the letter shereplied by asking him to go but to fix a definite date for his returne was given four weeks leave of absencever since that leave of absence had expired more than a fortnightbefore atasha had been in a constant state of alarm depression andirritabilityenisov now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied withthe present state of affairs had arrived during that fortnight elooked at atasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of aperson once dear  dull dejected look random replies and talk aboutthe nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantressatasha was sad and irritable all that time especially when her motherher brother onya or ountess ary in their efforts to console hertried to excuse ierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returningts all nonsense all rubbishthose discussions which lead to nothingand all those idiotic societies atasha declared of the very affairsin the immense importance of which she firmly believednd she would go to the nursery to nurse etya her only boy o oneelse could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as thislittle threemonthold creature when he lay at her breast and she wasconscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his littlenose hat creature said ou are angry you are jealous you wouldlike to pay him out you are afraidbut here am  nd  am he andthat was unanswerable t was more than trueuring that

needed hile attending to him she bore the anxiety about herhusband more easilyhe was nursing her boy when the sound of ierres sleigh was heard atthe front door and the old nurseknowing how to please

s in every large household there were at ald ills several perfectlydistinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole though eachretained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others veryevent joyful or sad that took place in that house was important to allthese worlds but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieveover that occurrence independently of the othersor

feeling but by theiracts and way of lifewere glad of ierres return because they knewthat when he was there ount icholas would cease going every day toattend to the estate and would be in better

learnedwise and kind like ierre n ierres presence his face always shonewith pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when ierre spoke tohim e did not miss a single word he uttered and would afterwardswith essalles or by himself recall and reconsider the meaning ofeverything ierre had said ierres past life and his unhappiness priorto  of which young icholas had formed a vague poetic picture fromsome words he had overheard his adventures in oscow his captivitylaton arataev of whom he had heard from ierre his love for atashaof whom the lad was also particularly fond and especially ierresfriendship with the father whom icholas could not rememberall thismade ierre in his eyes a hero and a saintrom broken remarks about atasha and his father from the emotion withwhich ierre spoke of that dead father and from the careful reverenttenderness with which atasha spoke of him the boy who was only justbeginning to guess what love is derived the notion that his father hadloved atasha and when dying had left her to his friend ut the fatherwhom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could notbe pictured and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart andtears of sadness and rapture o the boy also was happy that ierre hadarrivedhe guests welcomed ierre because he always helped to enliven and uniteany company he was inhe grownup members of the family not to mention his wife werepleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothlyand peacefullyhe old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them andespecially that atasha would now be herself againierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and madehaste to satisfy all their expectationshough the most absentminded and forgetful of men ierre with the aidof a list his wife drew up had now bought everything not forgettinghis motherand brotherinlaws commissions nor the dress material fora present to elova nor toys for his wifes nephews n the early daysof his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expecthim not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy and hehad been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip heforgot everything ut in time he grew used to this demand nowing thatatasha asked nothing for herself and gave him commissions for othersonly when he himself had offered to undertake them he now found anunexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents foreveryone in the house and never forgot anything f he now incurredatashas censure it was only for buying too many and too expensivethings o her other defects as most people thought them but which toierre were qualities of untidiness and neglect of herself she nowadded stinginessrom the time that ierre began life as a family man on a footingentailing heavy expenditure he had noticed to his surprise that hespent only half as much as before and that his affairswhich had beenin disorder of late chiefly because of his first wifes debtshadbegun to improveife was cheaper because it was circumscribed that most expensiveluxury the kind of life that can be changed at any moment was nolonger his nor did he wish for it e felt that his way of life had nowbeen settled once for all till death and that to change it was not inhis power and so that way of life proved economicalith a merry smiling face ierre was sorting his purchaseshat do you think of this said he unrolling a piece of stuff like ashopmanatasha who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on herlap turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things heshowed herhats for elova xcellent he felt the quality of the materialt was a ruble an arshin  supposeierre told her the priceoo dear atasha remarked ow pleased the children will be andamma too nly you need not have bought me this she added unable tosuppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearlsof a kind then just coming into fashiondele tempted me she kept on telling me to buy it returned ierrehen am  to wear it and atasha stuck it in her coil of hair hen take little asha into society erhaps they will be fashionable againby then ell lets go nownd collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then tothe old countess roomshe countess was sitting with her companion elova playing grandpatience as usual when ierre and atasha came into the drawing roomwith parcels under their armshe countess was now over sixty was quite gray and wore a cap with afrill that surrounded her face er face had shriveled her upper liphad sunk in and her eyes were dimfter the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession shefelt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and leftwithout aim or object for her existence he ate drank slept or keptawake but did not live ife gave her no new impressions he wantednothing from life but tranquillity and that tranquillity only deathcould give her ut until death came she had to go on living that isto use her vital forces  peculiarity one sees in very young childrenand very old people was particularly evident in her er life had noexternal aimsonly a need to exercise her various functions andinclinations was apparent he had to eat sleep think speak weepwork give vent to her anger and so on merely because she had astomach a brain muscles nerves and a liver he did these things notunder any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do whenbehind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising theirfunctions remains unnoticed he talked only because she physicallyneeded to exercise her tongue and lungs he cried as a child doesbecause her nose had to be cleared and so on hat for people in theirfull vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretexthus in the morningespecially if she had eaten anything rich the daybeforeshe felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiestpretext elovas deafnesshe would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other endof the roomt seems a little warmer today my dear she would murmurnd when elova replied h yes theyve come she would mutterangrily  ord ow stupid and deaf she isnother pretext would be her snuff which would seem too dry or too dampor not rubbed fine enough fter these fits of irritability her facewould grow yellow and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when elovawould again be deaf the snuff damp and the countess face yellow ustas she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exerciseher stillexisting faculty of thinkingand the pretext for that was agame of patience hen she needed to cry the deceased count would bethe pretext hen she wanted to be agitated icholas and his healthwould be the pretext and when she felt a need to speak spitefully thepretext would be ountess ary hen her vocal organs needed exercisewhich was usually toward seven oclock when she had had an afterdinnerrest in a darkened room the pretext would be the retelling of the samestories over and over again to the same audiencehe old ladys condition was understood by the whole household though noone ever spoke of it and they all made every possible effort to satisfyher needs nly by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile betweenicholas ierre atasha and ountess ary was the commonunderstanding of her condition expressedut those glances expressed something more they said that she hadplayed her part in life that what they now saw was not her whole selfthat we must all become like her and that they were glad to yield toher to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly asfull of life as themselves but now so much to be pitied ementomori said these glancesnly the really heartless the stupid ones of that household and thelittle children failed to understand this and avoided her hen ierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was inone of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion ofplaying patience and sothough by force of habit she greeted him withthe words she always used when ierre or her son returned after anabsence igh time my dear high time e were all weary of waitingfor you ell thank od and received her presents with anothercustomary remark ts not the gift thats precious my dear but thatyou give it to me an old womanyet it was evident that she was notpleased by ierres arrival at that moment when it diverted herattention from the unfinished gamehe finished her game of patience and only then examined the presentshey consisted of a box for cards of splendid workmanship a brightblue evres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lidand a gold snuffbox with the counts portrait on the lid which ierrehad had done by a miniaturist in etersburg he countess had longwished for such a box but as she did not want to cry just then sheglanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly tothe box for cardshank you my dear you have cheered me up said she as she alwaysdid ut best of all you have brought yourself backfor  never sawanything like it you ought to give your wife a scolding hat are we todo with her he is like a mad woman when you are away oesnt seeanything doesnt remember anything she went on repeating her usualphrases ook nna imofeevna she added to her companion see whata box for cards my son has brought uselova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress materialhough ierre atasha icholas ountess ary and enisov had much totalk about that they could not discuss before the old countessnot thatanything was hidden from her but because she had dropped so farbehindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in herpresence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and torepeat what they had already told her many times that soandso wasdead and soandso was married which she would again be unable torememberyet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room fromhabit and ierre answered the countess questions as to whether rinceasili had aged and whether ountess ary lexeevna had sent greetingsand still thought of them and other matters that interested no

old countess e spoke of what heknew might interest the old lady and that she could understand e toldher of external social events and of the people who had formed thecircle of her contemporaries and had once been a real living anddistinct group but who were now for the most part scattered about theworld and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests theyhad sown in earlier years ut to the old countess those contemporariesof hers seemed to be the only serious and real society atasha saw byierres animation that his visit had been interesting and that he hadmuch to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess enisovnot being a member of the family did not understand ierres cautionand being as a malcontent much interested in what was occurring inetersburg kept urging ierre to tell them about what had happened inthe emenovsk regiment then about rakcheev and then about the ibleociety nce or twice ierre was carried away and began to speak ofthese things but icholas

resolute at the samovarand questioned ierre he curlyheaded delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a cornerstarting every now and then and muttering something to himself andevidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curlyhead with his thin neck exposed by his turndown collar toward theplace where ierre sathe conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in powerin which most people see the chief interest of home politics enisovdissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointmentsin the service heard with pleasure of the things done in etersburgwhich seemed to him stupid and made forcible and sharp comments on whatierre told themne used to have to be a ermannow one must dance with atawinova andadame wudener and wead

criedicholas though free from enisovs readiness to find fault witheverything also thought that discussion of the government was a veryserious and weighty matter and the fact that  had been appointedinister of his and  overnor eneral of hat and that the mperorhad said soandso and this minister soandso seemed to him veryimportant nd so he thought it necessary to take an interest in thesethings and to question ierre he questions put by these two kept theconversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about thehigher government circlesut atasha knowing all her husbands ways and ideas saw that he hadlong been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation toanother channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake ofwhich he had gone to etersburg to consult with his new friend rinceheodore and she helped him by asking how his affairs with rinceheodore had gonehat was it about asked icholaslways the same thing said ierre looking round at his listenersverybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot beallowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men tocounteract it as far as they canhat can decent men do icholas inquired frowning slightly hatcan be donehy thisome into my study said icholasatasha who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby nowheard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery

asked enisovlways some fantastic schemes said icholashy this began ierre not sitting down but pacing the roomsometimes stopping short gesticulating and lisping the position inetersburg is this the mperor does not look into anything e hasabandoned himself altogether to this mysticism ierre could nottolerate mysticism in anyone now e seeks only for peace and onlythese people sans foi ni loi  can give it himpeople who recklesslyhack at and strangle everythingagnitski rakcheev and tuttiquanti ou will agree that if you did not look after your estatesyourself but only wanted a quiet life the harsher your steward was themore readily your object might be attained he said to icholas ithout faith or lawell what does that lead up to said icholasell everything is going to ruin obbery in the law courts in thearmy nothing but flogging drilling and ilitary ettlements thepeople are tortured enlightenment is suppressed ll that is young andhonest is crushed veryone sees that this cannot go on verything isstrained to such a degree that it will certainly break said ierre asthose who examine the actions of any government have always said sincegovernments began  told them just one thing in etersburgold whomell you know whom said ierre with a meaning glance from under hisbrows rince heodore and all those o encourage culture andphilanthropy is all very well of course he aim is excellent but in thepresent circumstances something else is neededt that moment icholas noticed the presence of his nephew is facedarkened and he went up to the boyhy are you herehy et him be said ierre taking icholas by the arm andcontinuing hat is not enough  told them omething else is neededhen you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any momentwhen everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe as many aspossible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the generalcalamity verything that is young and strong is being enticed away anddepraved ne is lured by women another

independence and action as wellicholas who had left his nephew irritably pushed up an armchair satdown in it and listened to ierre coughing discontentedly and frowningmore and moreut action with what aim he cried nd what position will you adopttoward the governmenthy the position of assistants he society need not be secret if thegovernment allows it ot merely is it not hostile to government but itis a society of true conservativesa society of gentlemen in the fullmeaning of that word t is only to prevent some ugachev or other fromkilling my children and yours and rakcheev from sending me off to someilitary ettlement e join hands only for the public welfare and thegeneral safetyes but its a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful onewhich can only cause harmhy id the ugendbund which saved urope they did not then ventureto suggest that ussia had saved urope do any harm he ugendbund isan alliance of virtue it is love mutual help it is what hristpreached on the rossatasha who had come in during the conversation looked joyfully at herhusband t was not what he was saying that pleased herthat did noteven interest her for it seemed to her that was all extremely simpleand that she had known it a long time it seemed so to her because sheknew that it sprang from ierres whole soul but it was his animatedand enthusiastic appearance that made her gladhe boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turndown collarwhom everyone had forgottengazed at ierre with even greater and morerapturous joy very word of ierres burned into his heart and with anervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing waxand quill pens his hands came upon on his uncles tablet is not at all what you suppose but that is what the ermanugendbund was and what  am proposingo my fwiend he ugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eatersbut  dont understand it and cant even pwonounce it interposedenisov in a loud and resolute voice  agwee that evewything here iswotten and howwible but the ugendbund  dont understand f were notsatisfied let us have a bunt of our own hats all wight e suisvote homme  m your manierre smiled atasha began to laugh but icholas knitted his browsstill more and began proving to ierre that there was no prospect of anygreat change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in hisimagination ierre maintained the contrary and as his mental facultieswere greater and more resourceful icholas felt himself cornered hismade him still angrier for he was fully convinced not by reasoning butby something within him stronger than reason of the justice of hisopinion will tell you this he said rising and trying with nervouslytwitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner but finallyabandoning the attempt  cant prove it to you ou say thateverything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming  dont seeit ut you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditionalmatter and to that  reply ou are my best friend as you know butif you formed a secret society and began working against the governmentbe it what it may know it is my duty to obey the government nd ifrakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you and cut you down should not hesitate an instant but should do it nd you may argueabout that as you liken awkward silence followed these words atasha was the first to speakdefending her husband and attacking her brother er defense was weakand inapt but she attained her object he conversation was resumed andno longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of icholas last remarkhen they all got up to go in to supper little icholas olkonski wentup to ierre pale and with shining radiant eyesncle ierre you no f apa were alive would he agree withyou he askednd ierre suddenly realized what a special independent complex andpowerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in thisboy during that conversation and remembering all he had said heregretted that the lad should have heard him e had however to givehim an answeres  think so he said reluctantly and left the studyhe lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what hehad done to the things on the table e flushed and went up to icholasncle forgive me  did that unintentionally he said pointing tothe broken sealing wax and pensicholas started angrilyll right all right he said throwing the bits under the tablend evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty he turned awayfrom the boyou ought not to have been here at all he said he conversation at supper was not about politics or societies butturned on the subject icholas liked bestrecollections of enisov started these and ierre was particularly agreeable and amusingabout them he family separated on the most friendly termsfter supper icholas having undressed in his study and giveninstructions to the steward who had been waiting for him went to thebedroom in his dressing gown where he found his wife still at hertable writinghat are you writing ary icholas askedountess ary blushed he was afraid that what she was writing wouldnot be understood or approved by her husbandhe had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him but at the sametime was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have totell him diary icholas she replied handing him a blue exercise bookfilled with her firm bold writing diary icholas repeated with a shade of irony and he took up thebookt was in renchecember  oday when ndrusha her eldest boy woke up he did not wishto dress and ademoiselle ouise sent for me e was naughty andobstinate  tried threats but he only grew angrier hen  took thematter in hand  left him alone and began with nurses help to get theother children up telling him that  did not love him or a long timehe was silent as if astonished then he jumped out of bed ran to me inhis shirt and sobbed so that  could not calm him for a long time twas plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved mefterwards in the evening when  gave him his ticket he again begancrying piteously and kissing me ne can do anything with him bytendernesshat is a ticket icholas inquired have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening showing howthey have behavedicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him andcontinued to turn over the pages and read n the diary was set downeverything in the childrens lives that seemed noteworthy to theirmother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections oneducational methods hey were for the most part quite insignificanttrifles but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either nowthat he read this diary about his children for the first timender the date  was entereditya was naughty at table apa said he was to have no pudding e hadnone but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they wereeating  think that punishment by depriving children of sweets onlydevelops their greediness ust tell icholas thisicholas put down the book and looked at his wife he radiant eyesgazed at him questioningly would he approve or disapprove of her diaryhere could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of hisadmiration for his wifeerhaps it need not be done so pedantically thought icholas or evendone at all but this untiring continual spiritual effort of which thesole aim was the childrens moral welfare delighted him ad icholasbeen able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steadytender and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder ather spirituality and at the lofty moral world almost beyond his reachin which she had her beinge was proud of her intelligence and goodness recognized his owninsignificance beside her in the spiritual world and rejoiced all themore that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part ofhimself quite quite approve my dearest said he with a significant lookand after a short pause he added nd  behaved badly today ouwerent in the study e began disputingierre and and  lost mytemper ut he is impossible such a child  dont know what wouldbecome of him if atasha didnt keep him in hand ave you any ideawhy he went to etersburg hey have formedes

the government and that the oathof allegiance and duty  am sorry you werent there hey all fell onmeenisov and atasha atasha is absurd ow she rules over himnd yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her ownbut only repeats his sayings added icholas yielding to thatirresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest anddearest to us e forgot that what he was saying about atasha couldhave been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wifees  have noticed that said ountess aryhen  told him that duty and the oath were above everything hestarted proving goodness knows what  pity you were not therewhatwould you have saids  see it you were quite right and  told atasha so ierre sayseverybody is suffering tortured and being corrupted and that it isour duty to help our neighbor f course he is right there saidountess ary but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to usduties indicated to us by od imself and that though we might exposeourselves to risks we must not risk our childrenes thats it hats just what  said to him put in icholas whofancied he really had said it ut they insisted on their own viewlove of ones neighbor and hristianityand all this in the presence ofyoung icholas who had gone into my study and broke all my thingsh icholas do you know  am often troubled about little icholassaid ountess ary e is such an exceptional boy  am afraid neglect him in favor of my own we all have children and relations whilehe has no one e is constantly alone with his thoughtsell  dont think you need reproach yourself on his account ll thatthe fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing forhim and of course  am glad of it e is a fine lad a fine lad hisevening he listened to ierre in a sort of trance and fancyas we weregoing in to supper  looked and he had broken everything on my table tobits and he told me of it himself at once  never knew him to tell anuntruth  fine lad a fine lad repeated icholas who at heart wasnot fond of icholas olkonski but was always anxious to recognize thathe was a fine ladtill  am not the same as his own mother said ountess ary feel  am not the same and it troubles me  wonderful boy but  amdreadfully afraid for him t would be good for him to have companionsell it wont be for long ext summer ll take him to etersburgsaid icholas es ierre always was a dreamer and always will be hecontinued returning to the talk in the study which had evidentlydisturbed him ell what business is it of mine what goes on therewhether rakcheev is bad and all that hat business was it of minewhen  married and was so deep in debt that  was threatened withprison and had a mother who could not see or understand it nd thenthere are you and the children and our affairs s it for my ownpleasure that  am at the farm or in the office from morning to nighto but  know  must work to comfort my mother to repay you and notto leave the children such beggars as  wasountess ary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread aloneand that he attached too much importance to these matters ut she knewshe must not say this and that it would be useless to do so he onlytook his hand and kissed it e took this as a sign of approval and aconfirmation of his thoughts and after a few minutes reflectioncontinued to think aloudou know ary today lias itrofanych this was his overseer cameback from the ambov estate and told me they are already offering eightythousand rubles for the forestnd with an eager face icholas began to speak of the possibility ofrepurchasing tradnoe before long and added nother ten years of lifeand  shall leave the children in an excellent positionountess ary listened to her husband and understood all that he toldher he knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimesask her what he had been saying and be vexed if he noticed that she hadbeen thinking about something else ut she had to force herself toattend for what he was saying did not interest her at all he lookedat him and did not think but felt about something different he felta submissive tender love for this man who would never understand allthat she understood and this seemed to make her love for him stillstronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness esides thisfeeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from followingthe details of her husbands plans thoughts that had no connection withwhat he was saying flitted through her mind he thought of her nephewer husbands account of the boys agitation while ierre was speakingstruck her forcibly and various traits of his gentle sensitivecharacter recurred to her mind and while thinking of her nephew shethought also of her own children he did not compare them with him butcompared her feeling for them with her feeling for him and felt withregret that there was something lacking in her feeling for youngicholasometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from thedifference in their ages but she felt herself to blame toward him andpromised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossibleinthis life to love her husband her children little icholas and allher neighbors as hrist loved mankind ountess arys soul alwaysstrove toward the infinite the eternal and the absolute and couldtherefore never be at peace  stern expression of the lofty secretsuffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face icholasgazed at her  od hat will become of us if she dies as  alwaysfear when her face is like that thought he and placing himself beforethe icon he began to say his evening prayers atasha and ierre left alone also began to talk as only a husband andwife can talk that is with extraordinary clearness and rapidityunderstanding and expressing each others thoughts in ways contrary toall rules of logic without premises deductions or conclusions and ina quite peculiar way atasha was so used to this kind of talk with herhusband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrongbetween them if ierre followed a line of logical reasoning hen hebegan proving anything or talking argumentatively and calmly and sheled on by his example began to do the same she knew that they were onthe verge of a quarrelrom the moment they were alone and atasha came up to him with wideopen happy eyes and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosomsaying ow you are all mine mine ou wont escapefrom thatmoment this conversation began contrary to all the laws of logic andcontrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about atone and the same time his simultaneous discussion of many topics didnot prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surestsign that they fully understood one anotherust as in a dream when all is uncertain unreasoning andcontradictory except the feeling that guides the dream so in thisintercourse contrary to all laws of reason the words themselves werenot consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted thematasha spoke to ierre about her brothers life and doings of how shehad suffered and lacked life during his own absence and of how she wasfonder than ever of ary and how ary was in every way better thanherself n saying this atasha was sincere in acknowledging aryssuperiority but at the same time by saying it she made a demand onierre that he should all the same prefer her to ary and to all otherwomen and that now especially after having seen many women inetersburg he should tell her so afreshierre answering atashas words told her how intolerable it had beenfor him to meet ladies

she understands children t is asif she saw straight into their souls esterday for instance itya wasnaughtyow like his father he is ierre interjectedatasha knew why he mentioned ityas likeness to icholas therecollection of his dispute with his brotherinlaw was unpleasant andhe wanted to know what atasha thought of iticholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generallyaccepted ut  understand that you value what opens up a fresh linesaid she repeating words ierre had once utteredo the chief point is that to icholas ideas and discussions are anamusementalmost a pastime said ierre or instance he iscollecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book tillhe has read what he had already boughtismondi and ousseau andontesquieu he added with a smile ou know how much  he beganto soften down what he had said but atasha interrupted him to showthat this was unnecessaryo you say ideas are an amusement to himes and for me nothing else is serious ll the time in etersburg saw everyone as in a dream hen  am taken up by a thought all else ismere amusementh m so sorry  wasnt there when you met the children saidatasha hich was most delighted isa m surees ierre replied and went on with what was in his mind icholassays we ought not to think ut  cant help it esides when  was inetersburg  felt  can say this to you that the whole affair would goto pieces without meeveryone was pulling his own way ut  succeededin uniting them all and then my idea is so clear and simple ou see dont say that we ought to oppose this and that e may be mistakenhat  say is oin hands you who love the right and let there be butone bannerthat of active virtue rince ergey is a fine fellow andcleveratasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of ierres ideabut one thing disconcerted her an a man so important and necessary tosociety be also my husband ow did this happen he wished to expressthis doubt to him ow who could decide whether he is really clevererthan all the others she asked herself and passed in review all thosewhom ierre most respected udging by what he had said there was no onehe had respected so highly as laton arataevo you know what  am thinking about she asked bout latonarataev ould he have approved of you now do you thinkierre was not at all surprised at this question e understood hiswifes line of thoughtlaton arataev he repeated and pondered evidently sincerely tryingto imagine arataevs opinion on the subject e would not haveunderstood yet perhaps he would love you awfully atasha suddenly said wfully awfullyo he would not have approved said ierre after reflection hathe would have approved of is our family life e was always so anxiousto find seemliness happiness and peace in everything and  shouldhave been proud to let him see us here nowyou talk of my absencebut you wouldnt believe what a special feeling  have for you after aseparationes  should think atasha begano its not that  never leave off loving you nd one couldnt lovemore but this is something special es of course he did notfinish because their eyes meeting said the resthat nonsense it is atasha suddenly exclaimed about honeymoonsand that the greatest happiness is at first n the contrary now is thebest of all f only you did not go away o you remember how wequarreled nd it was always my fault lways mine nd what wequarreled about dont even rememberlways about the same thing said ierre with a smile ealoont say it  cant bear it atasha cried and her eyes glitteredcoldly and vindictively id you see her she added after a pauseo and if  had  shouldnt have recognized herhey were silent for a whileh do you know hile you were talking in the study  was looking atyou atasha began evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that hadcome over them ou are as like him as two peaslike the boy hemeant her little son h its time to go to him he milkscome ut m sorry to leave youhey were silent for a few seconds hen suddenly turning to one anotherat the same time they both began to speak ierre began with selfsatisfaction and enthusiasm atasha with a quiet happy smile avinginterrupted one another they both stopped to let the other continueo hat did you say o on go ono you go on  was talking nonsense said atashaierre finished what he had begun t was the sequel to his complacentreflections on his success in etersburg t that moment it seemed tohim that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of ussiansociety and to the whole world only wished to say that ideas that have great results are alwayssimple ones y whole idea is that if vicious people are united andconstitute a power then honest folk must do the same ow thats simpleenoughesnd what were you going to say nly nonsenseut all the sameh nothing only a trifle said atasha smilingly still morebrightly  only wanted to tell you about etya today nurse was comingto take him from me and he laughed shut his eyes and clung to me msure he thought he was hiding wfully sweet here

essalles slept propped up on four pillows and hisoman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring ittle icholas who hadjust waked up in a cold perspiration sat up in bed and gazed before himwith wideopen

icholas turned to look atierre but ierre was no longer there n his place was his fatherrince ndrewand his father had neither shape nor form but heexisted and when little icholas perceived him he grew

ierre h what a wonderful man he is nd my father hather ather es  will do something with which even he would besatisfied  istory is the life of nations and of humanity o seize and put intowords to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a singlenation appears impossiblehe ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describeand seize the apparently elusivethe life of a people hey describedthe activity of individuals who ruled the people and regarded theactivity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nationhe question how did individuals make nations act as they wished and bywhat was the will of these individuals themselves guided the ancientsmet by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will ofa chosen man and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplishends that were predestinedor the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the directparticipation of the eity in human affairsodern history in theory rejects both these principlest would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in manssubjection to the eity and in a predetermined aim toward which nationsare led modern history should study not the manifestations of power butthe causes that produce it ut modern history has not done this avingin theory rejected the view held by the ancients it still follows themin practicenstead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by thewill of od modern history has given us either heroes endowed withextraordinary superhuman capacities or simply men of very variouskinds from monarchs to journalists who lead the masses nstead of theformer divinely appointed aims of the ewish reek or oman nationswhich ancient historians regarded as representing the progress ofhumanity modern history has postulated its own aimsthe welfare of therench erman or nglish people or in its highest abstraction thewelfare and civilization of humanity in general by which is usuallymeant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of alarge continentodern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients withoutreplacing them by a new conception and the logic of the situation hasobliged the historians after they had apparently rejected the divineauthority of the kings and the fate of the ancients to reach the sameconclusion by another road that is to recognize  nations guided byindividual men and  the existence of a known aim to which thesenations and humanity at large are tendingt the basis of the works of all the modern historians from ibbon touckle despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty oftheir outlooks lie those two old unavoidable assumptionsn the first place the historian describes the activity of individualswho in his opinion have directed humanity one historian considers onlymonarchs generals and ministers as being such men while anotherincludes also orators learned men reformers philosophers and poetsecondly it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being ledis known to the historians to one of them this goal is the greatness ofthe oman panish or rench realm to another it is liberty equalityand a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world calleduropen  a ferment arises in aris it grows spreads and is expressedby a movement of peoples from west to east everal times it

the instinctive plain and mostlegitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters themonuments and tradition of that periodor a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to thescience of history whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to knowthemselvesf history had retained the conception of the ancients it would havesaid that od to reward or punish his people gave apoleon power anddirected his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends and that replywould have been clear and complete ne might believe or disbelieve inthe divine significance of apoleon but for anyone believing in itthere would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of thatperiod nor would there have been any contradictionsut modern history cannot give that reply cience does not admit theconception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the eityin human affairs and therefore history ought to give other answersodern history replying to these questions says you want to know whatthis movement means what caused it and what force produced theseevents hen listenouis  was a very proud and selfconfident man he had such and suchmistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled rance badly isdescendants were weak men and they too ruled rance badly nd they hadsuch and such favorites and such and such mistresses oreover certainmen wrote some books at that time t the end of the eighteenth centurythere were a couple of dozen men in aris who began to talk about allmen being free and equal his caused people all over rance to begin toslash at and drown one another hey killed the king and many otherpeople t that time there was in rance a man of geniusapoleon econquered everybody everywherethat is he killed many people becausehe was a great genius nd for some reason he went to kill fricans andkilled them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned torance he ordered everybody to obey him and they all obeyed him avingbecome an mperor he again went out to kill people in taly ustriaand russia nd there too he killed a great many n ussia there wasan mperor lexander who decided to restore order in urope andtherefore fought against apoleon n  he suddenly made friends withhim but in  they again quarreled and again began killing manypeople apoleon led six hundred thousand men into ussia and capturedoscow then he suddenly ran away from oscow and the mperorlexander helped by the advice of tein and others united urope toarm against the disturber of its peace ll apoleons allies suddenlybecame his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces heraised he llies defeated apoleon entered aris forced apoleon toabdicate and sent him to the island of lba not depriving him of thetitle of mperor and showing him every respect though five years beforeand one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigandhen ouis  who till then had been the laughingstock both of therench and the llies began to reign nd apoleon shedding tearsbefore his ld uards renounced the throne and went into exile henthe skillful statesmen and diplomatists especially alleyrand whomanaged to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and therebyextended the frontiers of rance talked in ienna and by theseconversations made the nations happy or unhappy uddenly thediplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point ofagain ordering their armies to kill one another but just then apoleonarrived in rance with a battalion and the rench who had been hatinghim immediately all submitted to him ut the llied monarchs wereangry at this and went to fight the rench once more nd they defeatedthe genius apoleon and suddenly recognizing him as a brigand sent himto the island of t elena nd the exile separated from the belovedrance so dear to his heart died a lingering death on that rock andbequeathed his great deeds to posterity ut in urope a reactionoccurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress theirsubjectst would be a mistake to think that this is ironica caricature of thehistorical accounts n the contrary it is a very mild expression of thecontradictory replies not meeting the questions which all thehistorians give from the compilers of memoirs and the histories ofseparate states to the writers of general histories and the newhistories of the culture of that periodhe strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact thatmodern history like a deaf man answers questions no one has askedf the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement ofhumanity and of the peoples the first questionin the absence of areply to which all the rest will be incomprehensibleis what is thepower that moves peoples o this modern history laboriously replieseither that apoleon was a great genius or that ouis  was veryproud or that certain writers wrote certain booksll that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it but it is notwhat was asked ll that would be interesting if we recognized a divinepower based on itself and always consistently directing its nationsthrough apoleons ouises and writers but we do not acknowledge sucha power and therefore before speaking about apoleons ouises andauthors we ought to be shown the connection existing between these menand the movement of the nationsf instead of a divine power some other force has appeared it should beexplained in what this new force consists for the whole interest ofhistory lies precisely in that forceistory seems to assume that this force is selfevident and known toeveryone ut in spite of every desire to regard it as known anyonereading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this newforce so variously understood by the historians themselves is reallyquite well known to everybody hat force moves the nationsiographical historians and historians of separate nations understandthis force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers n their narrationevents occur solely by the will of a apoleon and lexander or ingeneral of the persons they describe he answers given by this kind ofhistorian to the question of what force causes events to happen aresatisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each events soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin todescribe the same event the replies they give immediately lose allmeaning for this force is understood by them all not only differentlybut often in quite contradictory ways ne historian says that an eventwas produced by apoleons power another that it was produced bylexanders a third that it was due to the power of some other personesides this historians of that kind contradict each other even intheir statement as to the force on which the authority of someparticular person was based hiers a onapartist says that apoleonspower was based on his virtue and genius anfrey a epublican says itwas based on his trickery and deception of the people o the historiansof this class by mutually destroying one anothers positions destroythe understanding of the force which produces events and furnish noreply to historys essential questionriters of universal history who deal with all the nations seem torecognize how erroneous is the specialist historians view of the forcewhich produces events hey do not recognize it as a power inherent inheroes and rulers but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variouslydirected forces n describing a war or the subjugation of a people ageneral historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power ofone man but in the interaction of many persons connected with theeventccording to this view the power of historical personages representedas the product of many forces can no longer it would seem be regardedas a force that itself produces events et in most cases universalhistorians still employ the conception of power as a force that itselfproduces events and treat it as their cause n their exposition anhistoric character is first the product of his time and his power onlythe resultant of various forces and then his power is itself a forceproducing events ervinus chlosser and others for instance at onetime prove apoleon to be a product of the evolution of the ideas of and so forth and at another plainly say that the campaign of and other things they do not like were simply the product of apoleonsmisdirected will and that the very ideas of  were arrested in theirdevelopment by apoleons caprice he ideas of the evolution and thegeneral temper of the age produced apoleons power ut apoleonspower suppressed the ideas of the evolution and the general temper ofthe agehis curious contradiction is not accidental ot only does it occur atevery step but the universal historians accounts are all made up of achain of such contradictions his contradiction occurs because afterentering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfwayo find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force thesum of the components must equal the resultant his condition is neverobserved by the universal historians and so to explain the resultantforces they are obliged to admit in addition to the insufficientcomponents another unexplained force affecting the resultant actionpecialist historians describing the campaign of  or the restorationof the ourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by thewill of lexander ut the universal historian ervinus refuting thisopinion of the specialist historian tries to prove that the campaign of and the restoration of the ourbons were due to other things besidelexanders willsuch as the activity of tein etternich adame detael alleyrand ichte hateaubriand and others he historianevidently decomposes lexanders power into the components alleyrandhateaubriand and the restbut the sum of the components that is theinteractions of hateaubriand alleyrand adame de tael and theothers evidently does not equal the resultant namely the phenomenon ofmillions of renchmen submitting to the ourbons hat hateaubriandadame de tael and others spoke certain words to one another onlyaffected their mutual relations but does not account for the submissionof millions nd therefore to explain how from these relations of theirsthe submission of millions of people resultedthat is how componentforces equal to one  gave a resultant equal to a thousand times thehistorian is again obliged to fall back on powerthe force he haddeniedand to recognize it as the resultant of the forces that is hehas to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant nd that isjust what the universal historians do and consequently they not onlycontradict the specialist historians but contradict themselveseasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain say according towhether they want rain or fine weather he wind has blown the cloudsaway or he wind has brought up the clouds nd in the same way theuniversal historians sometimes when it pleases them and fits in withtheir theory say that power is the result of events and sometimeswhen they want to prove something else say that power produces events third class of historiansthe socalled historians of culturefollowing the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimesaccept writers and ladies as forces producing eventsagain take thatforce to be something quite different hey see it in what is calledculturein mental activityhe historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to theirprogenitors the writers of universal histories for if historicalevents may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated oneanother in such and such ways why not explain them by the fact thatsuch and such people wrote such and such books f the immense number ofindications accompanying every vital phenomenon these historians selectthe indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication isthe cause ut despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of eventslies in intellectual activity only by a great stretch can one admitthat there is any connection between intellectual activity and themovement of peoples and in no case can one admit that intellectualactivity controls peoples actions for that view is not confirmed bysuch facts as the very cruel murders of the rench evolution resultingfrom the doctrine of the equality of man or the very cruel wars andexecutions resulting from the preaching of loveut even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments withwhich these histories are filledadmitting that nations are governed bysome undefined force called an ideahistorys essential question stillremains unanswered and to the former power of monarchs and to theinfluence of advisers and other people introduced by the universalhistorians another newer forcethe ideais added the connection ofwhich with the masses needs explanation t is possible to understandthat apoleon had power and so events occurred with some effort one mayeven conceive that apoleon together with other influences was the causeof an event but how a book e ontrat ocial had the effect of makingrenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without anexplanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the eventndoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneouslyand so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectualactivity of men and their historical movements just as such aconnection may be found between the movements of humanity and commercehandicraft gardening or anything else you please ut why intellectualactivity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause orexpression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand nlythe following considerations can have led the historians to such aconclusion  that history is written by learned men and so it isnatural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their classsupplies the basis of the movement of all humanity just as a similarbelief is natural and agreeable to traders agriculturists and soldiersif they do not express it that is merely because traders and soldiersdo not write history and  that spiritual activity enlightenmentcivilization culture ideas are all indistinct indefinite conceptionsunder whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still lessdefinite meaning and which can therefore be readily introduced into anytheoryut not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kindwhich may possibly even be of use to someone for something thehistories of culture to which all general histories tend more and moreto approximate are significant from the fact that after seriously andminutely examining various religious philosophic and politicaldoctrines as causes of events as soon as they have to describe anactual historic event such as the campaign of  for instance theyinvoluntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of powerandsay plainly that that was the result of apoleons will peaking sothe historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves and showthat the new force they have devised does not account for what happensin history and that history can only be explained by introducing apower which they apparently do not recognize  locomotive is moving omeone asks hat moves it  peasant saysthe devil moves it nother man says the locomotive moves because itswheels go round  third asserts that the cause of its movement lies inthe smoke which the wind carries awayhe peasant is irrefutable e has devised a complete explanation orefute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil oranother peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devilbut a erman who moves the locomotive nly then as a result of thecontradiction will they see that they are both wrong ut the man whosays that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself forhaving once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further whythe wheels go round and till he has reached the ultimate cause of themovement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler hehas no right to stop in his search for the cause he man who explainsthe movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back hasnoticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken thefirst sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as anexplanationhe only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive isthat of a force commensurate with the movement observedhe only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is thatof some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peopleset to supply this conception various historians take forces ofdifferent kinds all of which are incommensurate with the movementobserved ome see it as a force directly inherent in heroes as thepeasant sees the devil in the locomotive others as a force resultingfrom several other forces like the movement of the wheels others againas an intellectual influence like the smoke that is blown awayo long as histories are written of separate individuals whetheraesars lexanders uthers or oltaires and not the histories ofall absolutely all those who take part in an event it is quiteimpossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conceptionof a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain endnd the only such conception known to historians is that of powerhis conception is the one handle by means of which the material ofhistory as at present expounded can be dealt with and anyone whobreaks that handle off as uckle did without finding some other methodof treating historical material merely deprives himself of the onepossible way of dealing with it he necessity of the conception ofpower as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by theuniversal historians and historians of culture themselves for theyprofessedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it atevery stepn dealing with humanitys inquiry the science of history up to now islike money in circulationpaper money and coin he biographies andspecial national histories are like paper money hey can be used andcan circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and evenadvantageously as long as no one asks what is the security behind themou need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events andsuch histories as hiers will be interesting and instructive and mayperhaps even possess a tinge of poetry ut just as doubts of the realvalue of paper money arise either because being easy to make too muchof it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold so alsodoubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either becausetoo many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heartsomeone inquires by what force did apoleon do thisthat is wants toexchange the current paper money for the real gold of actualcomprehensionhe writers of universal histories and of the history of culture arelike people who recognizing the defects of paper money decide tosubstitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravityof gold t may indeed make jingling coin but will do no more thanthat aper money may deceive the ignorant but nobody is deceived bytokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle s gold isgold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for useso universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply tohistorys essential question what is power he universal historiansgive contradictory replies to that question while the historians ofculture evade it and answer something quite different nd as countersof imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree toaccept them as gold or among those who do not know the nature of goldso universal historians and historians of culture not answeringhumanitys essential question serve as currency for some purposes oftheir own only in universities and among the mass of readers who have ataste for what they call serious reading aving abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divinesubjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjectionof that mans will to the eity history cannot without contradictionstake a single step till it has chosen one of two things either a returnto the former belief in the direct intervention of the eity in humanaffairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producinghistorical events and termed power return to the first is impossible the belief has been destroyed andso it is essential to explain what is meant by powerapoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war e are soaccustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the questionwhy did six hundred thousand men go to fight when apoleon utteredcertain words seems to us senseless e had the power and so what heordered was donehis reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was givenhim by od ut as soon as we do not admit that it becomes essential todetermine what is this power of one man over otherst cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak onea domination based on the application or threat of physical force likethe power of ercules nor can it be based on the effect of moral forceas in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leadingfigures in history are heroes that is men gifted with a specialstrength of soul and mind called genius his power cannot be based onthe predominance of moral strength for not to mention heroes such asapoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely historyshows us that neither a ouis  nor a etternich who ruled overmillions of people had any particular moral qualities but on thecontrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions theyruled overf the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moralqualities of him who possesses it it must evidently be looked forelsewherein the relation to the people of the man who wields thepowernd that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudencethat exchange bank of history which offers to exchange historysunderstanding of power for true goldower is the collective will of the people transferred by expressed ortacit consent to their chosen rulersn the domain of jurisprudence which consists of discussions of how astate and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to bearranged it is all very clear but when applied to history thatdefinition of power needs explanationhe science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancientsregarded firenamely as something existing absolutely ut forhistory the state and power are merely phenomena just as for modernphysics fire is not an element but a phenomenonrom this fundamental difference between the view held by history andthat held by jurisprudence it follows that jurisprudence can tellminutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what powerexisting immutably outside timeis but to historys questions aboutthe meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothingf power be the collective will of the people transferred to theirruler was ugachev a representative of the will of the people f notthen why was apoleon  hy was apoleon  a criminal when he wastaken prisoner at oulogne and why later on were those criminals whomhe arrestedo palace revolutionsin which sometimes only two or three people takeparttransfer the will of the people to a new ruler n internationalrelations is the will of the people also transferred to theirconqueror as the will of the onfederation of the hine transferred toapoleon in  as the will of the ussian people transferred toapoleon in  when our army in alliance with the rench went tofight the ustrianso these questions three answers are possibleither to assume  that the will of the people is alwaysunconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen andthat therefore every emergence of a new power every struggle againstthe power once appointed should be absolutely regarded as aninfringement of the real power or  that the will of the people istransferred to the rulers conditionally under definite and knownconditions and to show that all limitations conflicts and evendestructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of theconditions under which their power was entrusted to them or  thatthe will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally butthat the conditions are unknown and indefinite and that the appearanceof several authorities their struggles and their falls result solelyfrom the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknownconditions on which the will of the people is transferred from somepeople to othersnd these are the three ways in which the historians do explain therelation of the people to their rulersome historiansthose biographical and specialist historians alreadyreferred toin their simplicity failing to understand the question ofthe meaning of power seem to consider that the collective will of thepeople is unconditionally transferred to historical persons andtherefore when describing some single state they assume that particularpower to be the one absolute and real power and that any other forceopposing this is not a power but a violation of powermere violenceheir theory suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of historyhas the inconveniencein application to complex and stormy periods inthe life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously andstruggle with one anotherthat a egitimist historian will prove thatthe ational onvention the irectory and onaparte were mereinfringers of the true power while a epublican and a onapartist willprove the one that the onvention and the other that the mpire was thereal power and that all the others were violations of power videntlythe explanations furnished by these historians being mutuallycontradictory can only satisfy young childrenecognizing the falsity of this view of history another set ofhistorians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the willof the people to their rulers and that historical leaders have poweronly conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of thepeople has by tacit agreement prescribed to them ut what this programconsists in these historians do not say or if they do they continuallycontradict one anotherach historian according to his view of what constitutes a nationsprogress looks for these conditions in the greatness wealth freedomor enlightenment of citizens of rance or some other country ut not tomention the historians contradictions as to the nature of this programor even admitting that some one general program of these conditionsexiststhe facts of history almost always contradict that theory fthe conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealthfreedom and enlightenment of the people how is it that ouis  andvan the errible end their reigns tranquilly while ouis  andharles  are executed by their people o this question historiansreply that ouis s activity contrary to the program reacted onouis  ut why did it not react on ouis  or on ouis whyshould it react just on ouis  nd what is the time limit for suchreactions o these questions there are and can be no answers quallylittle does this view explain why for several centuries the collectivewill is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs and thensuddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to theonvention to the irectory to apoleon to lexander to ouis to apoleon again to harles  to ouis hilippe to a epublicangovernment and to apoleon  hen explaining these rapid transfersof the peoples will from one individual to another especially in viewof international relations conquests and alliances the historians areobliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegationsof the peoples will but are accidents dependent on cunning onmistakes on craft or on the weakness of a diplomatist a ruler or aparty leader o that the greater part of the events of historycivilwars revolutions and conquestsare presented by these historians notas the results of free transferences of the peoples will but asresults of the illdirected will of one or more individuals that isonce again as usurpations of power nd so these historians also seeand admit historical events which are exceptions to the theoryhese historians resemble a botanist who having noticed that someplants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons should insist that allthat grows does so by sprouting into two leaves and that the palm themushroom and even the oak which blossom into full growth and no longerresemble two leaves are deviations from the theoryistorians of the third class assume that the will of the people istransferred to historic personages conditionally but that theconditions are unknown to us hey say that historical personages havepower only because they fulfill the will of the people which has beendelegated to themut in that case if the force that moves nations lies not in thehistoric leaders but in the nations themselves what significance havethose leadershe leaders these historians tell us express the will of the peoplethe activity of the leaders represents the activity of the peopleut in that case the question arises whether all the activity of theleaders serves as an expression of the peoples will or only some partof it f the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression ofthe peoples will as some historians suppose then all the details ofthe court scandals contained in the biographies of a apoleon or aatherine serve to express the life of the nation which is evidentnonsense but if it is only some particular side of the activity of anhistorical leader which serves to express the peoples life as othersocalled philosophical historians believe then to determine whichside of the activity of a leader expresses the nations life we havefirst of all to know in what the nations life consistset by this difficulty historians of that class devise some mostobscure impalpable and general abstraction which can cover allconceivable occurrences and declare this abstraction to be the aim ofhumanitys movement he most usual generalizations adopted by almostall the historians are freedom equality enlightenment progresscivilization and culture ostulating some generalization as the goalof the movement of humanity the historians study the men of whom thegreatest number of monuments have remained kings ministers generalsauthors reformers popes and journalists to the extent to which intheir opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstractionut as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist infreedom equality enlightenment or civilization and as the connectionof the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only basedon the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people isalways transferred to the men whom we have noticed it happens that theactivity of the millions who migrate burn houses abandon agricultureand destroy one another never is expressed in the account of theactivity of some dozen people who did not burn houses practiceagriculture or slay their fellow creaturesistory proves this at every turn s the ferment of the peoples of thewest at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastwardexplained by the activity of ouis   and  their mistressesand ministers and by the lives of apoleon ousseau ideroteaumarchais and otherss the movement of the ussian people eastward to azan and iberiaexpressed by details of the morbid character of van the errible and byhis correspondence with urbskis the movement of the peoples at the time of the rusades explained bythe life and activity of the odfreys and the ouises and their ladiesor us that movement of the peoples from west to east without leaderswith a crowd of vagrants and with eter the ermit remainsincomprehensible nd yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of thatmovement when a rational and sacred aim for the rusadethe deliveranceof erusalemhad been clearly defined by historic leaders opeskings and knights incited the peoples to free the oly and but thepeople did not go for the unknown cause which had previously impelledthem to go no longer existed he history of the odfreys and theinnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples nd thehistory of the odfreys and the innesingers has remained the history ofodfreys and innesingers but the history of the life of the peoplesand their impulses has remained unknowntill less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us thelife of the peopleshe history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions oflife and thought of a writer or a reformer e learn that uther had ahot temper and said such and such things we learn that ousseau wassuspicious and wrote such and such books but we do not learn why afterthe eformation the peoples massacred one another nor why during therench evolution they guillotined one anotherf we unite both these kinds of history as is done by the newesthistorians we shall have the history of monarchs and writers but notthe history of the life of the peoples he life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men forthe connection between those men and the nations has not been found hetheory that this connection is based on the transference of thecollective will of a people to certain historical personages is anhypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of historyhe theory of the transference of the collective will of the people tohistoric persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudenceand be essential for its purposes but in its application to history assoon as revolutions conquests or civil wars occurthat is as soon ashistory beginsthat theory explains nothinghe theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of thepeoples will cannot be verified for it never occurredhatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs thetheory can always say that such and such a person took the lead becausethe collective will was transferred to himhe replies this theory gives to historical questions are like thereplies of a man who watching the movements of a herd of cattle andpaying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in differentparts of the field or to the driving of the herdsman should attributethe direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its headhe herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads itand the collective will of all the other animals is vested in thatleader his is what historians of the first class saythose whoassume the unconditional transference of the peoples willf the animals leading the herd change this happens because thecollective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader toanother according to whether the animal is or is not leading them inthe direction selected by the whole herd uch is the reply historianswho assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulersunder conditions which they regard as known ith this method ofobservation it often happens that the observer influenced by thedirection he himself prefers regards those as leaders who owing to thepeoples change of direction are no longer in front but on one sideor even in the rearf the animals in front are continually changing and the direction ofthe whole herd is constantly altered this is because in order to followa given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals thathave attracted our attention and to study the movements of the herd wemust watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on allsides of the herd o say the third class of historians who regard allhistorical persons from monarchs to journalists as the expression oftheir agehe theory of the transference of the will of the people to historicpersons is merely a paraphrasea restatement of the question in otherwordshat causes historical events ower hat is power ower is thecollective will of the people transferred to one person nder whatcondition is the will of the people delegated to one person ncondition that that person expresses the will of the whole people hatis power is power in other words power is a word the meaning of whichwe do not understandf the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoningthen having subjected to criticism the explanation of power thatjuridical science gives us humanity would conclude that power is merelya word and has no real existence ut to understand phenomena man hasbesides abstract reasoning experience by which he verifies hisreflections nd experience tells us that power is not merely a word butan actually existing phenomenonot to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activityof men can do without the conception of power the existence of power isproved both by history and by observing contemporary eventshenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear by whose will theevent seems to have taken place apoleon  issues a decree and therench go to exico he ing of russia and ismarck issue decrees andan army enters ohemia apoleon  issues a decree and an army entersussia lexander  gives a command and the rench submit to theourbons xperience shows us that whatever event occurs it is alwaysrelated to the will of one or of several men who have decreed ithe historians in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divineintervention in human affairs want to see the cause of events in theexpression of the will of someone endowed with power but thatsupposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experiencen the one side reflection shows that the expression of a mans willhis wordsare only part of the general activity expressed in an eventas for instance in a war or a revolution and so without assuming anincomprehensible supernatural forcea miracleone cannot admit thatwords can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men nthe other hand even if we admitted that words could be the cause ofevents history shows that the expression of the will of historicalpersonages does not in most cases produce any effect that is to saytheir commands are often not executed and sometimes the very oppositeof what they order occursithout admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity wecannot regard power as the cause of eventsower from the standpoint of experience is merely the relation thatexists between the expression of someones will and the execution ofthat will by otherso explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish aconception of the expression of will referring it to man and not to theeityf the eity issues a command expresses is will as ancient historytells us the expression of that will is independent of time and is notcaused by anything for the ivinity is not controlled by an event utspeaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men actingin time and in relation to one another to explain the connection ofcommands with events we must restore  the condition of all thattakes place the continuity of movement in time both of the events andof the person who commands and  the inevitability of the connectionbetween the person commanding and those who execute his command nly the expression of the will of the eity not dependent on time canrelate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years orcenturies and only the eity independent of everything can by issole will determine the direction of humanitys movement but man actsin time and himself takes part in what occurseinstating the first condition omitted that of time we see that nocommand can be executed without some preceding order having been givenrendering the execution of the last command possibleo command ever appears spontaneously or itself covers a whole seriesof occurrences but each command follows from another and never refersto a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an eventhen for instance we say that apoleon ordered armies to go to war wecombine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutivecommands dependent one on another apoleon could not have commanded aninvasion of ussia and never did so oday he ordered such and suchpapers to be written to ienna to erlin and to etersburg tomorrowsuch and such decrees and orders to the army the fleet thecommissariat and so on and so onmillions of commands which formed awhole series corresponding to a series of events which brought therench armies into ussiaf throughout his reign apoleon gave commands concerning an invasion ofngland and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effortand yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute thatdesign but undertook an expedition into ussia with which country heconsidered it desirable to be in alliance a conviction he repeatedlyexpressedthis came about because his commands did not correspond tothe course of events in the first case but did so correspond in thelatteror an order to be certainly executed it is necessary that a man shouldorder what can be executed ut to know what can and what cannot beexecuted is impossible not only in the case of apoleons invasion ofussia in which millions participated but even in the simplest eventfor in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent itsexecution very order executed is always one of an immense numberunexecuted ll the impossible orders inconsistent with the course ofevents remain unexecuted nly the possible ones get linked up with aconsecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events andare executedur false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedesit is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out ofthousands of others those few commands which were consistent with thatevent have been executed we forget about the others that were notexecuted because they could not be part from that the chief source ofour error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historicalaccounts a whole series of innumerable diverse and petty events suchfor instance as all those which led the rench armies to ussia isgeneralized into one event in accord with the result produced by thatseries of events and corresponding with this generalization the wholeseries of commands is also generalized into a single expression of wille say that apoleon wished to invade ussia and invaded it n realityin all apoleons activity we never find anything resembling anexpression of that wish but find a series of orders or expressions ofhis will very variously and indefinitely directed mid a long seriesof unexecuted orders of apoleons one series for the campaign of was carried outnot because those orders differed in any way from theother unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course ofevents that led the rench army into ussia just as in stencil workthis or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on fromthis side or in that way but because it was laid on from all sides overthe figure cut in the stencilo that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events wefind that a command can never be the cause of the event but that acertain definite dependence exists between the twoo understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary toreinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not fromthe eity but from a man which is that the man who gives the commandhimself takes part in the eventhis relation of the commander to those he commands is just what iscalled power his relation consists in the followingor common action people always unite in certain combinations in whichregardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action therelation between those taking part in it is always the sameen uniting in these combinations always assume such relations towardone another that the larger number take a more direct share and thesmaller number a less direct share in the collective action for whichthey have combinedf all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one ofthe most striking and definite examples is an armyvery army is composed of lower grades of the servicethe rank andfileof whom there are always the greatest number of the next highermilitary rankcorporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there arefewer and of stillhigher officers of whom there are still fewer andso on to the highest military command which is concentrated in oneperson military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone ofwhich the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and filethe next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the nexthigher grades of the army and so on to the apex the point of whichwill represent the commanderinchiefhe soldiers of whom there are the most form the lower section of thecone and its base he soldier himself does the stabbing hackingburning and pillaging and always receives orders for these actionsfrom men above him he himself never gives an order he noncommissionedofficers of whom there are fewer perform the action itself lessfrequently than the soldiers but they already give commands n officerstill less often acts directly himself but commands still morefrequently  general does nothing but command the troops indicates theobjective and hardly ever uses a weapon himself he commanderinchiefnever takes direct part in the action itself but only gives generalorders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops  similarrelation of people to one another is seen in every combination of menfor common activityin agriculture trade and every administrationnd so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of acone and of the ranks of an army or the ranks and positions in anyadministrative or public business whatever from the lowest to thehighest we see a law by which men to take associated action combinein such relations that the more directly they participate in performingthe action the less they can command and the more numerous they arewhile the less their direct participation in the action itself the morethey command and the fewer of them there are rising in this way fromthe lowest ranks to the man at the top who takes the least direct sharein the action and directs his activity chiefly to commandinghis relation of the men who command to those they command is whatconstitutes the essence of the conception called poweraving restored the condition of time under which all events occur wefind that a command is executed only when it is related to acorresponding series of events estoring the essential condition ofrelation between those who command and those who execute we find thatby the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest partin the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed tocommanding hen an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishesabout it and as the event results from the collective activity of manypeople some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to befulfilled if but approximately hen one of the opinions expressed isfulfilled that opinion gets connected with the event as a commandpreceding iten are hauling a log ach of them expresses his opinion as to how andwhere to haul it hey haul the log away and it happens that this isdone as one of them said e ordered it here we have command and powerin their primary form he man who worked most with his hands could notthink so much about what he was doing or reflect on or command whatwould result from the common activity while the man who commanded morewould evidently work less with his hands on account of his greaterverbal activityhen some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aimthere is a yet sharper division of those who because their activity isgiven to directing and commanding take less part in the direct workhen a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections whichas it seems to him directed his past activity justify his presentactivity and guide him in planning his future actions ust the same isdone by a concourse of people allowing those who do not take a directpart in the activity to devise considerations justifications andsurmises concerning their collective activityor reasons known or unknown to us the rench began to drown and killone another nd corresponding to the event its justification appears inpeoples belief that this was necessary for the welfare of rance forliberty and for equality eople ceased to kill one another and thisevent was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for acentralization of power resistance to urope and so on en went fromthe west to the east killing their fellow men and the event wasaccompanied by phrases about the glory of rance the baseness ofngland and so on istory shows us that these justifications of theevents have no common sense and are all contradictory as in the case ofkilling a man as the result of recognizing his rights and the killingof millions in ussia for the humiliation of ngland ut thesejustifications have a very necessary significance in their own dayhese justifications release those who produce the events from moralresponsibility hese temporary aims are like the broom fixed in frontof a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front they clearmens moral responsibilities from their pathithout such justification there would be no reply to the simplestquestion that presents itself when examining each historical event owis it that millions of men commit collective crimesmake war commitmurder and so onith the present complex forms of political and social life in uropecan any event that is not prescribed decreed or ordered by monarchsministers parliaments or newspapers be imagined s there anycollective action which cannot find its justification in politicalunity in patriotism in the balance of power or in civilization othat every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressedwish and receiving a justification presents itself as the result ofthe will of one man or of several menn whatever direction a ship moves the flow of the waves it cuts willalways be noticeable ahead of it o those on board the ship themovement of those waves will be the only perceptible motionnly by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow andcomparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves thatevery bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship andthat we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves wereimperceptibly movinge see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historicalcharacters that is reestablish the inevitable condition of all thatoccursthe continuity of movement in time and do not lose sight of theessential connection of historical persons with the masseshen the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same waveahead of it when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turnsfrequently ut wherever it may turn there always will be the waveanticipating its movementhatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen anddecreed herever the ship may go the rush of water which neitherdirects nor increases its movement foams ahead of it and at a distanceseems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the shipsmovement alsoxamining only those expressions of the will of historical personswhich as commands were related to events historians have assumed thatthe events depended on those commands ut examining the eventsthemselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood tothe people we have found that they and their orders were dependent onevents he incontestable proof of this deduction is that however manycommands were issued the event does not take place unless there areother causes for it but as soon as an event occursbe it what it maythen out of all the continually expressed wishes of different peoplesome will always be found which by their meaning and their time ofutterance are related as commands to the eventsrriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively tothese two essential questions of history hat is power hat force produces the movement of the nations ower is the relation of a given person to other individuals inwhich the more this person expresses opinions predictions andjustifications of the collective action that is performed the less ishis participation in that action he movement of nations is caused not by power nor by intellectualactivity nor even by a combination of the two as historians havesupposed but by the activity of all the people who participate in theevents and who always combine in such a way that those taking thelargest direct share in the event take on themselves the leastresponsibility and vice versaorally the wielder of power appears to cause the event physically itis those who submit to the power ut as the moral activity isinconceivable without the physical the cause of the event is neither inthe one nor in the other but in the union of the twor in other words the conception of a cause is inapplicable to thephenomena we are examiningn the last analysis we reach the circle of infinitythat final limitto which in every domain of thought mans reason arrives if it is notplaying with the subject lectricity produces heat heat produceselectricity toms attract each other and atoms repel one anotherpeaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms wecannot say why this occurs and we say that it is so because it isinconceivable otherwise because it must be so and that it is a law hesame applies to historical events hy war and revolution occur we donot know e only know that to produce the one or the other actionpeople combine in a certain formation in which they all take part andwe say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise or in otherwords that it is a law f history dealt only with external phenomena the establishment of thissimple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished ourargument ut the law of history relates to man  particle of mattercannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsionand that that law is untrue but man who is the subject of historysays plainly  am free and am therefore not subject to the lawhe presence of the problem of mans free will though unexpressed isfelt at every step of historyll seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered thisquestion ll the contradictions and obscurities of history and thefalse path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack ofa solution of that questionf the will of every man were free that is if each man could act as hepleased all history would be a series of disconnected incidentsf in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely thatis as he chose it is evident that one single free act of that mans inviolation of the laws governing human action would destroy thepossibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanityf there be a single law governing the actions of men free will cannotexist for then mans will is subject to that lawn this contradiction lies the problem of free will which from mostancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancienttimes has been presented in its whole tremendous significancehe problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation fromwhatever point of viewtheological historical ethical orphilosophicwe find a general law of necessity to which he like allthat exists is subject ut regarding him from within ourselves as whatwe are conscious of we feel ourselves to be freehis consciousness is a source of selfcognition quite apart from andindependent of reason hrough his reason man observes himself but onlythrough consciousness does he know himselfpart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reasonis conceivableo understand observe and draw conclusions man must first of all beconscious of himself as living  man is only conscious of himself as aliving being by the fact that he wills that is is conscious of hisvolition ut his willwhich forms the essence of his lifemanrecognizes and can but recognize as freef observing himself man sees that his will is always directed by oneand the same law whether he observes the necessity of taking foodusing his brain or anything else he cannot recognize this nevervarying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it ereit not free it could not be limited  mans will seems to him to belimited just because he is not conscious of it except as freeou say  am not free ut  have lifted my hand and let it fallveryone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutabledemonstration of freedomhat reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject toreasonf the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independentsource of selfconsciousness it would be subject to reasoning and toexperience but in fact such subjection does not exist and isinconceivable series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he as anobject of observation is subject to certain laws and man submits tothem and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he hasbecome acquainted with them ut the same series of experiments andarguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he isconscious in himself is impossible and that his every action depends onhis organization his character and the motives acting upon him yetman never submits to the deductions of these experiments and argumentsaving learned from experiment and argument that a stone fallsdownwards a man indubitably believes this and always expects the lawthat he has learned to be fulfilledut learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws he doesnot and cannot believe thisowever often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under thesame conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing asbefore yet when under the same conditions and with the same characterhe approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in thesame way he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment thathe can act as he pleases very man savage or sage howeverincontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it isimpossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely thesame conditions feels that without this irrational conception whichconstitutes the essence of freedom he cannot imagine life e feelsthat however impossible it may be it is so for without this conceptionof freedom not only would he be unable to understand life but he wouldbe unable to live for a single momente could not live because all mans efforts all his impulses to lifeare only efforts to increase freedom ealth and poverty fame andobscurity power and subordination strength and weakness health anddisease culture and ignorance work and leisure repletion and hungervirtue and vice are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived oflifef the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senselesscontradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one andthe same instant of time or of an effect without a cause that onlyproves that consciousness is not subject to reasonhis unshakable irrefutable consciousness of freedom uncontrolled byexperiment or argument recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyonewithout exception this consciousness without which no conception of manis possible constitutes the other side of the questionan is the creation of an allpowerful allgood and allseeing odhat is sin the conception of which arises from the consciousness ofmans freedom hat is a question for theologyhe actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed instatistics hat is mans responsibility to society the conception ofwhich results from the conception of freedom hat is a question forjurisprudenceans actions proceed from his innate character and the motives actingupon him hat is conscience and the perception of right and wrong inactions that follows from the consciousness of freedom hat is aquestion for ethicsan in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject tolaws which determine that life ut the same man apart from thatconnection appears to be free ow should the past life of nations andof humanity be regardedas the result of the free or as the result ofthe constrained activity of man hat is a question for historynly in our selfconfident day of the popularization of knowledgethanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance the diffusion ofprinted matterhas the question of the freedom of will been put on alevel on which the question itself cannot exist n our time themajority of socalled advanced peoplethat is the crowd ofignoramuseshave taken the work of the naturalists who deal with oneside of the question for a solution of the whole problemhey say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist forthe life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscularmovements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves the soul andfree will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprangfrom the apes hey say this not at all suspecting that thousands ofyears ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are nowtrying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merelyacknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers but has neverbeen denied hey do not see that the role of the natural sciences inthis matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination ofone side of it or the fact that from the point of view ofobservation reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain andthat man following the general law may have developed from lower animalsat some unknown period of time only explains from a fresh side thetruth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious andphilosophic theoriesthat from the point of view of reason man issubject to the law of necessity but it does not advance by a hairsbreadth the solution of the question which has another opposite sidebased on the consciousness of freedomf men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time that is ascomprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at acertain period of time in the first case the unknown quantity is thetime in the second case it is the origin and the question of howmans consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law ofnecessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparativephysiology and zoology for in a frog a rabbit or an ape we canobserve only the muscular nervous activity but in man we observeconsciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activityhe naturalists and their followers thinking they can solve thisquestion are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of achurch who availing themselves of the absence of the chiefsuperintendent of the work should in an access of zeal plaster over thewindows icons woodwork and still unbuttressed walls and should bedelighted that from their point of view as plasterers everything is nowso smooth and regular or the solution of the question of free will or inevitability historyhas this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which thequestion is dealt with that for history this question does not refer tothe essence of mans free will but its manifestation in the past andunder certain conditionsn regard to this question history stands to the other sciences asexperimental science stands to abstract sciencehe subject for history is not mans will itself but our presentation ofitnd so for history the insoluble mystery presented by theincompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it doesfor theology ethics and philosophy istory surveys a presentation ofmans life in which the union of these two contradictions has alreadytaken placen actual life each historic event each human action is very clearlyand definitely understood without any sense of contradiction althougheach event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsoryo solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and whatconstitutes the essence of these two conceptions the philosophy ofhistory can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by othersciences nstead of first defining the conceptions of freedom andinevitability in themselves and then ranging the phenomena of lifeunder those definitions history should deduce a definition of theconception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immensequantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appeardependent on these two elementshatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual wemay consider we always regard it as the result partly of mans freewill and partly of the law of inevitabilityhether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions ofthe barbarians or of the decrees of apoleon  or of someonesaction an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for hiswalk we are unconscious of any contradiction he degree of freedom andinevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly definedfor usur conception of the degree of freedom often varies according todifferences in the point of view from which we regard the event butevery human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom andinevitability n every action we examine we see a certain measure offreedom and a certain measure of inevitability nd always the morefreedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive andthe more inevitability the less freedomhe proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increasesaccording to the point of view from which the action is regarded buttheir relation is always one of inverse proportion sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him or a hungry motherexhausted by feeding her baby who steals some food or a man trained todiscipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless manseem less guilty that is less free and more subject to the law ofnecessity to one who knows the circumstances in which these people wereplaced and more free to one who does not know that the man was himselfdrowning that the mother was hungry that the soldier was in the ranksand so on imilarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago andhas since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guiltyand his action more due to the law of inevitability to someone whoconsiders his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one whoexamined it the day after it was committed nd in the same way everyaction of an insane intoxicated or highly excited man appears lessfree and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of himwho committed the action and seems more free and less inevitable to onewho does not know it n all these cases the conception of freedom isincreased or diminished and the conception of compulsion iscorrespondingly decreased or increased according to the point of viewfrom which the action is regarded o that the greater the conception ofnecessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versaeligion the common sense of mankind the science of jurisprudence andhistory itself understand alike this relation between necessity andfreedomll cases without exception in which our conception of freedom andnecessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations he relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds is relation to time is relation to the causes leading to the actionhe first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the mansrelation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness ofour understanding of the definite position occupied by the man inrelation to everything coexisting with him his is what makes itevident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessitythan one standing on dry ground and that makes the actions of a manclosely connected with others in a thickly populated district or of onebound by family official or business duties seem certainly less freeand more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude andseclusionf we consider a man alone apart from his relation to everything aroundhim each action of his seems to us free ut if we see his relation toanything around him if we see his connection with anything whateverwith a man who speaks to him a book he reads the work on which he isengaged even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on thethings about himwe see that each of these circumstances has aninfluence on him and controls at least some side of his activity ndthe more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of hisfreedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity thatweighs on him increaseshe second consideration is the more or less evident time relation ofthe man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the placethe mans action occupies in time hat is the ground which makes thefall of the first man resulting in the production of the human raceappear evidently less free than a mans entry into marriage today t isthe reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries agoand are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the lifeof a contemporary the consequences of which are still unknown to mehe degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in thisrespect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performanceof the action and our judgment of itf  examine an act  performed a moment ago in approximately the samecircumstances as those  am in now my action appears to me undoubtedlyfree ut if  examine an act performed a month ago then being indifferent circumstances  cannot help recognizing that if that act hadnot been committed much that resulted from itgood agreeable and evenessentialwould not have taken place f  reflect on an action stillmore remote ten years ago or more then the consequences of my actionare still plainer to me and  find it hard to imagine what would havehappened had that action not been performed he farther  go back inmemory or what is the same thing the farther  go forward in myjudgment the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of myactionn history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning thepart played by free will in the general affairs of humanity contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all theknown participants but with a more remote event we already see itsinevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possiblend the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary dothey appearhe ustrorussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of thecrafty conduct of ismarck and so on he apoleonic wars still seem tous though already questionably to be the outcome of their heroeswill ut in the rusades we already see an event occupying its definiteplace in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern historyof urope though to the chroniclers of the rusades that event appearedas merely due to the will of certain people n regard to the migrationof the peoples it does not enter anyones head today to suppose that therenovation of the uropean world depended on ttilas caprice hefarther back in history the object of our observation lies the moredoubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become andthe more manifest the law of inevitabilityhe third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endlesschain of causation inevitably demanded by reason in which eachphenomenon comprehended and therefore mans every action must have itsdefinite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause ofwhat will followhe better we are acquainted with the physiological psychological andhistorical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlledand the more correctly we perceive the physiological psychological andhistorical causes of the action and the simpler the action we areobserving and the less complex the character and mind of the man inquestion the more subject to inevitability and the less free do ouractions and those of others appearhen we do not at all understand the cause of an action whether acrime a good action or even one that is simply nonmoral we ascribe agreater amount of freedom to it n the case of a crime we most urgentlydemand the punishment for such an act in the case of a virtuous act werate its merit most highly n an indifferent case we recognize in itmore individuality originality and independence ut if even one ofthe innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certainelement of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crimeor the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act or the freedomof the apparently original action hat a criminal was reared among malefactors mitigates his fault in our eyes he selfsacrifice of a fatheror mother or selfsacrifice with the possibility of a reward is morecomprehensible than gratuitous selfsacrifice and therefore seems lessdeserving of sympathy and less the result of free will he founder of asect or party or an inventor impresses us less when we know how or bywhat the way was prepared for his activity f we have a large range ofexamples if our observation is constantly directed to seeking thecorrelation of cause and effect in peoples actions their actionsappear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly weconnect the effects with the causes f we examined simple actions andhad a vast number of such actions under observation our conception oftheir inevitability would be still greater he dishonest conduct of theson of a dishonest father the misconduct of a woman who had fallen intobad company a drunkards relapse into drunkenness and so on areactions that seem to us less free the better we understand their causef the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage ofmental development like a child a madman or a simpletonthenknowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character andintelligence in question we see so large an element of necessity and solittle free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the actionwe can foretell the resultn these three considerations alone is based the conception ofirresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admittedby all legislative codes he responsibility appears greater or lessaccording to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances inwhich the man was placed whose action is being judged and according tothe greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of theaction and its investigation and according to the greater or lesserunderstanding of the causes that led to the action hus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishesor increases according to the greater or lesser connection with theexternal world the greater or lesser remoteness of time and thegreater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which wecontemplate a mans lifeo that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with theexternal world is well known where the time between the action and itsexamination is great and where the causes of the action are mostaccessible we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and aminimum of free will f we examine a man little dependent on externalconditions whose action was performed very recently and the causes ofwhose action are beyond our ken we get the conception of a minimum ofinevitability and a maximum of freedomn neither casehowever we may change our point of view however plainwe may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the externalworld however inaccessible it may be to us however long or short theperiod of time however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes ofthe action may becan we ever conceive either complete freedom orcomplete necessity o whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from theinfluence of the external world we never get a conception of freedom inspace very human action is inevitably conditioned by what surroundshim and by his own body  lift my arm and let it fall y action seemsto me free but asking myself whether  could raise my arm in everydirection  see that  raised it in the direction in which there wasleast obstruction to that action either from things around me or fromthe construction of my own body  chose one out of all the possibledirections because in it there were fewest obstacles or my action tobe free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles oconceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space which isevidently impossible owever much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of thedeed we never get a conception of freedom in time or if  examine anaction committed a second ago  must still recognize it as not beingfree for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it wascommitted an  lift my arm  lift it but ask myself could  haveabstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed oconvince myself of this  do not lift it the next moment ut  am notnow abstaining from doing so at the first moment when  asked thequestion ime has gone by which  could not detain the arm  thenlifted is no longer the same as the arm  now refrain from lifting noris the air in which  lifted it the same that now surrounds me hemoment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable and at thatmoment  could make only one movement and whatever movement  madewould be the only one hat  did not lift my arm a moment later doesnot prove that  could have abstained from lifting it then nd since could make only one movement at that single moment of time it could nothave been any other o imagine it as free it is necessary to imagineit in the present on the boundary between the past and the futurethatis outside time which is impossible owever much the difficulty of understanding the causes may beincreased we never reach a conception of complete freedom that is anabsence of cause owever inaccessible to us may be the cause of theexpression of will in any action our own or anothers the first demandof reason is the assumption of and search for a cause for without acause no phenomenon is conceivable  raise my arm to perform an actionindependently of any cause but my wish to perform an action without acause is the cause of my actionut even ifimagining a man quite exempt from all influences examiningonly his momentary action in the present unevoked by any causewe wereto admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaledzero we should even then not have arrived at the conception of completefreedom in man for a being uninfluenced by the external world standingoutside of time and independent of cause is no longer a mann the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid offreedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability owever we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space inwhich man is situated that knowledge can never be complete for thenumber of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space ndtherefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are definedthere is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedomremains owever we may prolong the period of time between the action we areexamining and the judgment upon it that period will be finite whiletime is infinite and so in this respect too there can never be absoluteinevitability owever accessible may be the chain of causation of any action weshall never know the whole chain since it is endless and so again wenever reach absolute inevitabilityut besides this even if admitting the remaining minimum of freedom toequal zero we assumed in some given caseas for instance in that of adying man an unborn babe or an idiotcomplete absence of freedom byso doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we areexamining for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man ndso the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law ofinevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible asthe conception of a mans completely free actionnd so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law ofinevitability without any freedom we must assume the knowledge of aninfinite number of space relations an infinitely long period of timeand an infinite series of causeso imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law ofinevitability we must imagine him all alone beyond space beyond timeand free from dependence on causen the first case if inevitability were possible without freedom weshould have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws ofinevitability itself that is a mere form without contentn the second case if freedom were possible without inevitability weshould have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space time andcause which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited wouldbe nothing or mere content without forme should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which manswhole outlook on the universe is constructedthe incomprehensibleessence of life and the laws defining that essenceeason says  space with all the forms of matter that give itvisibility is infinite and cannot be imagined otherwise  ime isinfinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise he connection between cause and effect has no beginning and canhave no endonsciousness says   alone am and all that exists is but meconsequently  include space   measure flowing time by the fixedmoment of the present in which alone  am conscious of myself as livingconsequently  am outside time   am beyond cause for  feel myselfto be the cause of every manifestation of my lifeeason gives expression to the laws of inevitability onsciousnessgives expression to the essence of freedomreedom not limited by anything is the essence of life in mansconsciousness nevitability without content is mans reason in itsthree formsreedom is the thing examined nevitability is what examines reedomis the content nevitability is the formnly by separating the two sources of cognition related to one anotheras form to content do we get the mutually exclusive and separatelyincomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitabilitynly by uniting them do we get a clear conception of mans lifepart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define oneanother as form and content no conception of life is possiblell that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of freewill to inevitability that is of consciousness to the laws of reasonll that we know of the external world of nature is only a certainrelation of the forces of nature to inevitability or of the essence oflife to the laws of reasonhe great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious ofthem we call those forces gravitation inertia electricity animalforce and so on but we are conscious of the force of life in man andwe call that freedomut just as the force of gravitation incomprehensible in itself butfelt by every man is understood by us only to the extent to which weknow the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the firstknowledge that all bodies have weight up to ewtons law so too theforce of free will incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone isconscious is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws ofinevitability to which it is subject from the fact that every man diesup to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic lawsll knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under thelaws of reasonans free will differs from every other force in that man is directlyconscious of it but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from anyother force he forces of gravitation electricity or chemicalaffinity are only distinguished from one another in that they aredifferently defined by reason ust so the force of mans free will isdistinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by thedefinition reason gives it reedom apart from necessity that isapart from the laws of reason that define it differs in no way fromgravitation or heat or the force that makes things grow for reasonit is only a momentary undefinable sensation of lifend as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodiesthe undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity or ofchemical affinity or of the vital force forms the content ofastronomy physics chemistry botany zoology and so on just in thesame way does the force of free will form the content of history utjust as the subject of every science is the manifestation of thisunknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be thesubject of metaphysics even the manifestation of the force of free willin human beings in space in time and in dependence on cause forms thesubject of history while free will itself is the subject ofmetaphysicsn the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws ofinevitability what is unknown to us we call vital force ital force isonly an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we knowof the essence of lifeo also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitabilitywhat is unknown we call free will ree will is for history only anexpression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws ofhuman life istory examines the manifestations of mans free will in connectionwith the external world in time and in dependence on cause that is itdefines this freedom by the laws of reason and so history is a scienceonly in so far as this free will is defined by those lawshe recognition of mans free will as something capable of influencinghistorical events that is as not subject to laws is the same forhistory as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodieswould be for astronomyhat assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of lawsthat is of any science whatever f there is even a single body movingfreely then the laws of epler and ewton are negatived and noconception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists fany single action is due to free will then not a single historical lawcan exist nor any conception of historical eventsor history lines exist of the movement of human wills one end ofwhich is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which aconsciousness of mans will in the present moves in space time anddependence on causehe more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes the moreevident are the laws of that movement o discover and define those lawsis the problem of historyrom the standpoint from which the science of history now regards itssubject on the path it now follows seeking the causes of events inmans freewill a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossiblefor however mans free will may be restricted as soon as we recognizeit as a force not subject to law the existence of law becomesimpossiblenly by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal thatis by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity can we convinceourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes and theninstead of seeking causes history will take the discovery of laws asits problemhe search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods ofthought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneouslywith the selfdestruction toward whichever dissecting and dissectingthe causes of phenomenathe old method of history is movingll human sciences have traveled along that path rriving atinfinitesimals mathematics the most exact of sciences abandons theprocess of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration ofunknown infinitely small quantities bandoning the conception ofcause mathematics seeks law that is the property common to allunknown infinitely small elementsn another form but along the same path of reflection the other scienceshave proceeded hen ewton enunciated the law of gravity he did not saythat the sun or the earth had a property of attraction he said that allbodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attractingone another that is leaving aside the question of the cause of themovement of the bodies he expressed the property common to all bodiesfrom the infinitely large to the infinitely small he same is done bythe natural sciences leaving aside the question of cause they seek forlaws istory stands on the same path nd if history has for its objectthe study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not thenarration of episodes in the lives of individuals it too setting asidethe conception of cause should seek the laws common to all theinseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will rom the time the law of opernicus was discovered and proved the mererecognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that movessufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients y disprovingthat law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of themovements of the bodies but without disproving it it would seemimpossible to continue studying the tolemaic worlds ut even after thediscovery of the law of opernicus the tolemaic worlds were stillstudied for a long timerom the time the first person said and proved that the number of birthsor of crimes is subject to mathematical laws and that this or that modeof government is determined by certain geographical and economicconditions and that certain relations of population to soil producemigrations of peoples the foundations on which history had been builtwere destroyed in their essencey refuting these new laws the former view of history might have beenretained but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continuestudying historic events as the results of mans free will or if acertain mode of government was established or certain migrations ofpeoples took place in consequence of such and such geographicethnographic or economic conditions then the free will of thoseindividuals who appear to us to have established that mode of governmentor occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the causend yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with thelaws of statistics geography political economy comparative philologyand geology which directly contradict its assumptionshe struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornlyfought out in physical philosophy heology stood on guard for the oldviews and accused the new of violating revelation ut when truthconquered theology established itself just as firmly on the newfoundationust as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding betweenthe old and the new conception of history and theology in the same waystands on guard for the old view and accuses the new view of subvertingrevelationn the one case as in the other on both sides the struggle provokespassion and stifles truth n the one hand there is fear and regret forthe loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages on the otheris the passion for destructiono the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophyit seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith inod in the creation of the firmament and in the miracle of oshua theson of un o the defenders of the laws of opernicus and ewton tooltaire for example it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyedreligion and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon againstreligionust so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law ofinevitability to destroy the conception of the soul of good and eviland all the institutions of state and church that have been built up onthose conceptionso too like oltaire in his time uninvited defenders of the law ofinevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion thoughthe law of inevitability in history like the law of opernicus inastronomy far from destroying even strengthens the foundation on whichthe institutions of state and church are erecteds in the question of astronomy then so in the question of history nowthe whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition ornonrecognition of something absolute serving as the measure of visiblephenomena n astronomy it was the immovability of the earth in historyit is the independence of personalityfree wills with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earthlay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earths fixity and ofthe motion of the planets so in history the difficulty of recognizingthe subjection of personality to the laws of space time and cause liesin renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of ones ownpersonality ut as in astronomy the new view said t is true that wedo not feel the movement of the earth but by admitting its immobilitywe arrive at absurdity while by admitting its motion which we do notfeel we arrive at laws so also in history the new view says t istrue that we are not conscious of our dependence but by admitting ourfree will we arrive at absurdity while by admitting our dependence onthe external world on time and on cause we arrive at lawsn the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of anunreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel inthe present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom thatdoes not exist and to recognize a dependence of which we are notconsciousnd of the roject utenberg ook of
